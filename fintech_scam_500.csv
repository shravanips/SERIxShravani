"summary of ' bubbler ' a few months ago i posted an inquiry on the linguist listing on the distribution of the word "" bubbler "" as a synonym for drinking fountain . thanks to all who responded , which are too many to list . the dictionary of american regional english has also extensively investigated this word and it was my goal to gain more specific information than that supplied by dare ( for example , the regional distribution within wisconsin . ) here is a summary of my findings : in wisconsin , bubbler is used throughout the eastern half of the state , particularly along the coast of lake michigan and becomes less prominent the further west one travels . the "" stronghold "" of bubbler appears to be in milwaukee and its suburbs . milwaukee is also thought to be the geographic origin of bubbler , coined by the kohler company in the early 1900 's . my university ( uw - whitewater ) appears to be in conflict over what to call drinking fountains . in one of our residence halls there is a sign asking residents to not use the drinking fountain as a garbage disposal . the word 'd rinking ' is crossed out , and ' water ' is put in its place . then ' water ' and ' fountain ' are crossed out , and ' bubbler ' is put in their place . it goes to show you that people can be very loyal to their colloquialisms ! my research provided no evidence for the term 's use in minnesota or illinois , but i did find the word in use along the western part of michigan 's upper peninsula ( which borders wisconsin 's bubbler-using region . ) if bubbler is used anywhere else in the midwest , its existence escaped my research . in fact , i found no evidence of the word 's use within the u . s . west of the mississippi or south of the ohio river . the other region that uses the term includes the state of rhode island ( where it is used exclusively by many speakers ) , far eastern connecticut , and southeastern massachusetts - including the boston area . i had people from this region respond with amusement because they did n't know the word was used anywhere outside of their area . lastly , and much to my surprise , bubbler is used in southeastern australia - predominately in new south wales ( including sydney and canberra ) and in portions of the provinces bordering new south wales . the information on australia is only based on a few responses , but there were some , especially in sydney , who used bubbler exclusively while growing up . there were some from parts of australia who had never heard the term before , so it does appear that it is also regionally distributed in australia . there were some who distinguished bubblers from drinking fountains . some only called outside fountains , bubblers , while others vice versa . one only called non-refridgerating fountains , bubblers . drinking fountain seems to be the generic term that everyone is familiar with , whether they use it or not . other synonymns are : water fountain , water cooler , fountain , and water bubbler . for what its worth , the only accounts i had of the term ' water bubbler ' were among african americans from milwaukee ( but this only included three people . ) just plain ' fountain ' seemed to be the word of choice in northwestern wisconsin , while drinking fountain and water fountain were used pretty interchangeably everywhere else . as for its use in literature , the only printed documentation of bubbler i could find ( under the given definition ) was a 1985 milwaukee journal article which was about the word 's usage in milwaukee . i realize that some of my findings are inconsistent with dare - i believe this is because my research was not nearly as thorough as dare , and did n't take into account historical usage , only current usage . thanks again to those who responded . your avid bubbler user , sean christensen internet : seanc @ iclnet93 . iclnet . org university of wisconsin - whitewater",0,Safe,zefang_phishing_email_dataset,0,email,True

"towards culturally situated agents * * * call for papers and participation * * * issues in cross cultural communication "" towards culturally situated agents "" http : / / www . nttmsc . com . my / kido / pricai98cfp . html 24th of november 1998 , singapore introduction culture underlies every aspect of social behavior and influences communication style , personality , character , motivation , knowledge and cognition . there is an extensive body of work on cross-cultural differences in communication styles in the linguistics and cultural anthropology literature . in the intelligent user interface design community , over the years , fueled by the recognition that different types of users are motivated by different needs and goals , attention has been given to the development of adaptive user interfaces . however , this line of research and development has given little consideration to the influence that culture plays in shaping what users want out of the computational experience . in order to create interfaces that accommodate different user styles , therefore , it is important to understand these cultural influences , since , in many cases , a user will react to interfaces on the basis of cultural background . similarly , if we are to view an agent , software or robot as a social member of a "" cyber society , "" then that agent must be able to invoke cultural knowledge in order to communicate flexibly with human users and possibly other agents . if agents are reflective only of their designers ' communicative behaviors and are not able to adapt to the styles of other agents which they meet in heterogeneous , distributed environments and virtual reality worlds , then our agents may be trapped in a tower of babel . the goal of this workshop is to discuss cultural influences as they ( may ) inform interactions among human and software agents . this workshop is intended to attract participants from those communities concerned with such a perspective of communication . topics of interest the workshop aims to be interdisciplinary in nature and is therefore open to contributions from various research fields . the topics which the workshop addresses are relevant , for instance , in : anthropology , sociology , sociolinguistics , human computer interaction ( hci ) , cscw , machine learning , adaptive systems research , collaborative virtual environments , multi-media multi-user environments , ethnology , social sciences , psychology and cognitive science . the scope of this workshop includes , but need not be restricted to the following topics : * the nature of cross cultural communication , including case studies and examples * the origin and evolution of communication * linguistic and ethnographic studies of cross cultural communication * negotiation strategies among humans from different cultural backgrounds * negotiation strategies among agents informed by different cultural principles * user interfaces and new media for cross cultural communication * the impact of internet technology on cross cultural communication * culturally situated metaphors in interface , machine and agent design * ethnomethodology in interface and agent design * culturally dependent metaphors and language of describing and talking about humans , machines and agents : influences on the design process , theory / model building , and scientific experimentation * case studies of program execution problems due to agent to agent and human to agent miscommunication * standards which are open to the development of multiple ontologies of mult iagent communication in heterogeneous environments * working examples of culturally adaptive agents in multiagent or human-agent systems papers should address these topics in the context of how they relate to issues in agent design and agent behavior . participation and submission of papers the workshop will comprise a few keynote talks , a panel discussion with participants from different research areas and presentations of preliminary findings by workshop participants . participants will be selected by the organizing committee ( see below ) based on submitted papers . potential participants who wish to present their work at the workshop should submit a short paper ( up to 5 , 000 words ) or extended abstract ( 1 , 500 to 2 , 500 words ) . contributions should describe work in progress , completed work , positions , or give significant insight into the issues on cross cultural communication . other potential participants should send a statement of interest ( one page ) , briefly describing their work and their interest in the workshop . some of the participants will be asked to contribute a paper to the final working notes . all participants will be invited to bring a poster presenting their work . submissions should be sent by e-mail ( ascii , unix compatible postscript , or rtf ) to the workshop chair , takashi kido ,

"6 . 351 language policy frank ashen focussed on the divisive effects of promoting one of several indigenous languages to the position of official language and used the much quoted justification that speakers of not-chosen languages may feel disadvantaged . he did not mention the effect of the introduction of a foreign world language on the vernaculars . the introduction of foreign official language has , in africa , led to explicit negative attitudes amongst the speakers themselves towards their languages . the alternative to the selection of an indigenous language as official language seems to be to disadvantage the whole population . in most african countries the foreign official language generally has a very low penetration so that only the elite know it . knowledge of the official language then becomes a new factor that determines access to power and the well-paid jobs . at the same time the vernaculars are ignored or stigmatised . this means that no or very little funds are available for their development and teaching . this means , to come back to tove skutnabb - kangas ' comments , that the population cannot exercise their "" right to learn their mother tongue , both orally and in writing , up to a high level . "" the assumption that frank ashen quotes is based on a false departure point , namely that only a colonial language can save an african country from being torn up by its own internal divisions . i do n't recall any wars based on language differences prior to colonisation . africa solved its linguistic diversity by developing lingua francas . djit ? recently ( 1993 ) showed that the use of so-called international languages such as english and french have not solved the communication problems of the african masses but in many cases contributed towards the "" pathology of linguistic bakwardness "" . the fact that these languages ( such as wolof , swahili , hausa , lingala ) are actually spreading - without much official help - seems to indicate "" a general willingness for cooperation and a cultural and linguistic tolerance that ignores the political boundaries inherited from colonization "" djit ? ( 1993 : 162 ) . spencer ( 1985 : 395 ) claims that the introduction of european languages to africa retarded the spread of what he calls "" african vehicular languages "" . however , adegbija ( 1994 : 26-27 ) is sceptical of the ability of african lingua francas of being accepted outside their present geographical domains . he also warns against the imposition of these languages . it would seem that we need a three-language policy such as that of india : one language for communication with the outside world known by a relatively small section of the population ; one lingua franca for national and regional communication and the various vernaculars for local business and primary education . in many african countries this is the de facto situation and trilingualism is more common in africa than outside linguists seem to realise . this suggestion might avoid the subtractive language learning ( that characterises many african communities ) and that tove skutnabb - kangas finds "" a violation of minorities ' linguistic rights "" . the sources that i referred to : adegbija , e . 1994 language attitudes in africa : a sociolinguistic overview . clevedon : multilingual matters . djit ? , p . g . 1993 "" language development in africa .

Date: Not suppliedThe DoE has announced a high-speed data-transfer that runs on drillpipe, 
through ""a 4-inch diameter steel pipe immersed in electrically conductive mud 
at pressures up to 1000 atmospheres, temperatures up to 150 deg C, and with 
vibrational accelerations of hundreds of g's:""     Now, with a high-speed, bi-directional communications link, a drilling 
    system's azimuth, inclination, pressure, temperature, loads and vibration, 
    along with information on rock characteristics near the drill bit, can be 
    evaluated almost instantly. Also, because of the ability to send high-speed 
    data through the drill pipe, technologies once thought unobtainable ï¿½ such 
    as collecting seismic data at the drill bit ï¿½ may now be possible.     With high-resolution seismic data collected ""ahead of the bit,"" operators 
    could steer the drill bit more precisely toward oil- and gas-bearing sweet 
    spots and away from less productive areas. This will enhance the efficiency 
    of oil and gas wells and reduce the number of wells needed to produce a 
    reservoir.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via /.[3]_)[1] http://www.fossil.energy.gov/techline/tl_intellipipe.shtml

---------------------------------------------------------------------~->A new version of unison is now available for testing.  It incorporates
several small improvements over 2.9.1, but the main change is a fix to
a bug that had potentially serious safety consequences, but only for
the very small number of users that are in the habit of running more
than one instance of Unison at a time, in parallel.  These users are
strongly encouraged to upgrade.  Others can wait if they wish.The release includes pre-built executables for Linux and Solaris, but
not Windows.  (We are looking for a Unison-Windows maintainer -- at
the moment, none of the active developers are regularly using Unison
on Windows, and we do not have a machine that is configured properly
for building executables for export.)Grab it from here:
   http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/download.htmlEnjoy,        -- Benjamin   Changes since 2.9.1:
     * Added a preference maxthreads that can be used to limit the number
       of simultaneous file transfers.
     * Added a backupdir preference, which controls where backup files
       are stored.
     * Basic support added for OSX. In particular, Unison now recognizes
       when one of the hosts being synchronized is running OSX and
       switches to a case-insensitive treatment of filenames (i.e., 'foo'
       and 'FOO' are considered to be the same file). (OSX is not yet
       fully working, however: in particular, files with resource forks
       will not be synchronized correctly.)
     * The same hash used to form the archive name is now also added to
       the names of the temp files created during file transfer. The
       reason for this is that, during update detection, we are going to
       silently delete any old temp files that we find along the way, and
       we want to prevent ourselves from deleting temp files belonging to
       other instances of Unison that may be running in parallel, e.g.
       synchronizing with a different host. Thanks to Ruslan Ermilov for
       this suggestion.
     * Several small user interface improvements
     * Documentation
          + FAQ and bug reporting instructions have been split out as
            separate HTML pages, accessible directly from the unison web
            page.
          + Additions to FAQ, in particular suggestions about performance
            tuning.
     * Makefile
          + Makefile.OCaml now sets UISTYLE=text or UISTYLE=gtk
            automatically, depending on whether it finds lablgtk
            installed
          + Unison should now compile ``out of the box'' under OSX
       
   Changes since 2.8.1:
     * Changing profile works again under Windows
     * File movement optimization: Unison now tries to use local copy
       instead of transfer for moved or copied files. It is controled by
       a boolean option ``xferbycopying''.
     * Network statistics window (transfer rate, amount of data
       transferred). [NB: not available in Windows-Cygwin version.]
     * symlinks work under the cygwin version (which is dynamically
       linked).
     * Fixed potential deadlock when synchronizing between Windows and
       Unix
     * Small improvements:
          + If neither the
            tt USERPROFILE nor the
            tt HOME environment variables are set, then Unison will put
            its temporary commit log (called
            tt DANGER.README) into the directory named by the
            tt UNISON environment variable, if any; otherwise it will use
            tt C:.
          + alternative set of values for fastcheck: yes = true; no =
            false; default = auto.
          + -silent implies -contactquietly
     * Source code:
          + Code reorganization and tidying. (Started breaking up some of
            the basic utility modules so that the non-unison-specific
            stuff can be made available for other projects.)
          + several Makefile and docs changes (for release);
          + further comments in ``update.ml'';
          + connection information is not stored in global variables
            anymore.
       
   Changes since 2.7.78:
     * Small bugfix to textual user interface under Unix (to avoid
       leaving the terminal in a bad state where it would not echo inputs
       after Unison exited).
       
   Changes since 2.7.39:
     * Improvements to the main web page (stable and beta version docs
       are now both accessible).
     * User manual revised.
     * Added some new preferences:
          + ``sshcmd'' and ``rshcmd'' for specifying paths to ssh and rsh
            programs.
          + ``contactquietly'' for suppressing the ``contacting server''
            message during Unison startup (under the graphical UI).
     * Bug fixes:
          + Fixed small bug in UI that neglected to change the displayed
            column headers if loading a new profile caused the roots to
            change.
          + Fixed a bug that would put the text UI into an infinite loop
            if it encountered a conflict when run in batch mode.
          + Added some code to try to fix the display of non-Ascii
            characters in filenames on Windows systems in the GTK UI.
            (This code is currently untested---if you're one of the
            people that had reported problems with display of non-ascii
            filenames, we'd appreciate knowing if this actually fixes
            things.)
          + `-prefer/-force newer' works properly now. (The bug was
            reported by Sebastian Urbaniak and Sean Fulton.)
     * User interface and Unison behavior:
          + Renamed `Proceed' to `Go' in the graphical UI.
          + Added exit status for the textual user interface.
          + Paths that are not synchronized because of conflicts or
            errors during update detection are now noted in the log file.
          + [END] messages in log now use a briefer format
          + Changed the text UI startup sequence so that
            tt ./unison -ui text will use the default profile instead of
            failing.
          + Made some improvements to the error messages.
          + Added some debugging messages to remote.ml.
       
   Changes since 2.7.7:
     * Incorporated, once again, a multi-threaded transport sub-system.
       It transfers several files at the same time, thereby making much
       more effective use of available network bandwidth. Unlike the
       earlier attempt, this time we do not rely on the native thread
       library of OCaml. Instead, we implement a light-weight,
       non-preemptive multi-thread library in OCaml directly. This
       version appears stable.
       Some adjustments to unison are made to accommodate the
       multi-threaded version. These include, in particular, changes to
       the user interface and logging, for example:
          + Two log entries for each transferring task, one for the
            beginning, one for the end.
          + Suppressed warning messages against removing temp files left
            by a previous unison run, because warning does not work
            nicely under multi-threading. The temp file names are made
            less likely to coincide with the name of a file created by
            the user. They take the form
            .#..unison.tmp.
     * Added a new command to the GTK user interface: pressing 'f' causes
       Unison to start a new update detection phase, using as paths just
       those paths that have been detected as changed and not yet marked
       as successfully completed. Use this command to quickly restart
       Unison on just the set of paths still needing attention after a
       previous run.
     * Made the ignorecase preference user-visible, and changed the
       initialization code so that it can be manually set to true, even
       if neither host is running Windows. (This may be useful, e.g.,
       when using Unison running on a Unix system with a FAT volume
       mounted.)
     * Small improvements and bug fixes:
          + Errors in preference files now generate fatal errors rather
            than warnings at startup time. (I.e., you can't go on from
            them.) Also, we fixed a bug that was preventing these
            warnings from appearing in the text UI, so some users who
            have been running (unsuspectingly) with garbage in their
            prefs files may now get error reports.
          + Error reporting for preference files now provides file name
            and line number.
          + More intelligible message in the case of identical change to
            the same files: ``Nothing to do: replicas have been changed
            only in identical ways since last sync.''
          + Files with prefix '.#' excluded when scanning for preference
            files.
          + Rsync instructions are send directly instead of first
            marshaled.
          + Won't try forever to get the fingerprint of a continuously
            changing file: unison will give up after certain number of
            retries.
          + Other bug fixes, including the one reported by Peter Selinger
            (force=older preference not working).
     * Compilation:
          + Upgraded to the new OCaml 3.04 compiler, with the LablGtk
            1.2.3 library (patched version used for compiling under
            Windows).
          + Added the option to compile unison on the Windows platform
            with Cygwin GNU C compiler. This option only supports
            building dynamically linked unison executables.
       
   Changes since 2.7.4:
     * Fixed a silly (but debilitating) bug in the client startup
       sequence.
       
   Changes since 2.7.1:
     * Added addprefsto preference, which (when set) controls which
       preference file new preferences (e.g. new ignore patterns) are
       added to.
     * Bug fix: read the initial connection header one byte at a time, so
       that we don't block if the header is shorter than expected. (This
       bug did not affect normal operation --- it just made it hard to
       tell when you were trying to use Unison incorrectly with an old
       version of the server, since it would hang instead of giving an
       error message.)
       
   Changes since 2.6.59:
     * Changed fastcheck from a boolean to a string preference. Its legal
       values are yes (for a fast check), no (for a safe check), or
       default (for a fast check---which also happens to be safe---when
       running on Unix and a safe check when on Windows). The default is
       default.
     * Several preferences have been renamed for consistency. All
       preference names are now spelled out in lowercase. For backward
       compatibility, the old names still work, but they are not
       mentioned in the manual any more.
     * The temp files created by the 'diff' and 'merge' commands are now
       named by prepending a new prefix to the file name, rather than
       appending a suffix. This should avoid confusing diff/merge
       programs that depend on the suffix to guess the type of the file
       contents.
     * We now set the keepalive option on the server socket, to make sure
       that the server times out if the communication link is
       unexpectedly broken.
     * Bug fixes:
          + When updating small files, Unison now closes the destination
            file.
          + File permissions are properly updated when the file is behind
            a followed link.
          + Several other small fixes.
       
   Changes since 2.6.38:
     * Major Windows performance improvement!
       We've added a preference fastcheck that makes Unison look only at
       a file's creation time and last-modified time to check whether it
       has changed. This should result in a huge speedup when checking
       for updates in large replicas.
       When this switch is set, Unison will use file creation times as
       'pseudo inode numbers' when scanning Windows replicas for updates,
       instead of reading the full contents of every file. This may cause
       Unison to miss propagating an update if the create time,
       modification time, and length of the file are all unchanged by the
       update (this is not easy to achieve, but it can be done). However,
       Unison will never overwrite such an update with a change from the
       other replica, since it always does a safe check for updates just
       before propagating a change. Thus, it is reasonable to use this
       switch most of the time and occasionally run Unison once with
       fastcheck set to false, if you are worried that Unison may have
       overlooked an update.
       Warning: This change is has not yet been thoroughly field-tested.
       If you set the fastcheck preference, pay careful attention to what
       Unison is doing.
     * New functionality: centralized backups and merging
          + This version incorporates two pieces of major new
            functionality, implemented by Sylvain Roy during a summer
            internship at Penn: a centralized backup facility that keeps
            a full backup of (selected files in) each replica, and a
            merging feature that allows Unison to invoke an external
            file-merging tool to resolve conflicting changes to
            individual files.
          + Centralized backups:
               o Unison now maintains full backups of the
                 last-synchronized versions of (some of) the files in
                 each replica; these function both as backups in the
                 usual sense and as the ``common version'' when invoking
                 external merge programs.
               o The backed up files are stored in a directory
                 /.unison/backup on each host. (The name of this
                 directory can be changed by setting the environment
                 variable UNISONBACKUPDIR.)
               o The predicate backup controls which files are actually
                 backed up: giving the preference 'backup = Path *'
                 causes backing up of all files.
               o Files are added to the backup directory whenever unison
                 updates its archive. This means that
                    # When unison reconstructs its archive from scratch
                      (e.g., because of an upgrade, or because the
                      archive files have been manually deleted), all
                      files will be backed up.
                    # Otherwise, each file will be backed up the first
                      time unison propagates an update for it.
               o The preference backupversions controls how many previous
                 versions of each file are kept. The default is 2 (i.e.,
                 the last synchronized version plus one backup).
               o For backward compatibility, the backups preference is
                 also still supported, but backup is now preferred.
               o It is OK to manually delete files from the backup
                 directory (or to throw away the directory itself).
                 Before unison uses any of these files for anything
                 important, it checks that its fingerprint matches the
                 one that it expects.
          + Merging:
               o Both user interfaces offer a new 'merge' command,
                 invoked by pressing 'm' (with a changed file selected).
               o The actual merging is performed by an external program.
                 The preferences merge and merge2 control how this
                 program is invoked. If a backup exists for this file
                 (see the backup preference), then the merge preference
                 is used for this purpose; otherwise merge2 is used. In
                 both cases, the value of the preference should be a
                 string representing the command that should be passed to
                 a shell to invoke the merge program. Within this string,
                 the special substrings CURRENT1, CURRENT2, NEW, and OLD
                 may appear at any point. Unison will substitute these as
                 follows before invoking the command:
                    # CURRENT1 is replaced by the name of the local copy
                      of the file;
                    # CURRENT2 is replaced by the name of a temporary
                      file, into which the contents of the remote copy of
                      the file have been transferred by Unison prior to
                      performing the merge;
                    # NEW is replaced by the name of a temporary file
                      that Unison expects to be written by the merge
                      program when it finishes, giving the desired new
                      contents of the file; and
                    # OLD is replaced by the name of the backed up copy
                      of the original version of the file (i.e., its
                      state at the end of the last successful run of
                      Unison), if one exists (applies only to merge, not
                      merge2).
                 For example, on Unix systems setting the merge
                 preference to   merge = diff3 -m CURRENT1 OLD CURRENT2 > NEW
                 will tell Unison to use the external diff3 program for
                 merging.
                 A large number of external merging programs are
                 available. For example, emacs users may find the
                 following convenient:    merge2 = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2""
               nil ""NEW"")'
    merge = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files-with-ancestor
               ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2"" ""OLD"" nil ""NEW"")'
                 (These commands are displayed here on two lines to avoid
                 running off the edge of the page. In your preference
                 file, each should be written on a single line.)
               o If the external program exits without leaving any file
                 at the path NEW, Unison considers the merge to have
                 failed. If the merge program writes a file called NEW
                 but exits with a non-zero status code, then Unison
                 considers the merge to have succeeded but to have
                 generated conflicts. In this case, it attempts to invoke
                 an external editor so that the user can resolve the
                 conflicts. The value of the editor preference controls
                 what editor is invoked by Unison. The default is emacs.
               o Please send us suggestions for other useful values of
                 the merge2 and merge preferences -- we'd like to give
                 several examples in the manual.
     * Smaller changes:
          + When one preference file includes another, unison no longer
            adds the suffix '.prf' to the included file by default. If a
            file with precisely the given name exists in the .unison
            directory, it will be used; otherwise Unison will add .prf,
            as it did before. (This change means that included preference
            files can be named blah.include instead of blah.prf, so that
            unison will not offer them in its 'choose a preference file'
            dialog.)
          + For Linux systems, we now offer both a statically linked and
            a dynamically linked executable. The static one is larger,
            but will probably run on more systems, since it doesn't
            depend on the same versions of dynamically linked library
            modules being available.
          + Fixed the force and prefer preferences, which were getting
            the propagation direction exactly backwards.
          + Fixed a bug in the startup code that would cause unison to
            crash when the default profile (~/.unison/default.prf) does
            not exist.
          + Fixed a bug where, on the run when a profile is first
            created, Unison would confusingly display the roots in
            reverse order in the user interface.
     * For developers:
          + We've added a module dependency diagram to the source
            distribution, in src/DEPENDENCIES.ps, to help new prospective
            developers with navigating the code.
       
   Changes since 2.6.11:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The startup sequence has been completely
       rewritten and greatly simplified. The main user-visible change is
       that the defaultpath preference has been removed. Its effect can
       be approximated by using multiple profiles, with include
       directives to incorporate common settings. All uses of defaultpath
       in existing profiles should be changed to path.
       Another change in startup behavior that will affect some users is
       that it is no longer possible to specify roots both in the profile
       and on the command line.
       You can achieve a similar effect, though, by breaking your profile
       into two:
  default.prf =
      root = blah
      root = foo
      include common  common.prf =
      
       Now do  unison common root1 root2
       when you want to specify roots explicitly.
     * The -prefer and -force options have been extended to allow users
       to specify that files with more recent modtimes should be
       propagated, writing either -prefer newer or -force newer. (For
       symmetry, Unison will also accept -prefer older or -force older.)
       The -force older/newer options can only be used when -times is
       also set.
       The graphical user interface provides access to these facilities
       on a one-off basis via the Actions menu.
     * Names of roots can now be ``aliased'' to allow replicas to be
       relocated without changing the name of the archive file where
       Unison stores information between runs. (This feature is for
       experts only. See the ``Archive Files'' section of the manual for
       more information.)
     * Graphical user-interface:
          + A new command is provided in the Synchronization menu for
            switching to a new profile without restarting Unison from
            scratch.
          + The GUI also supports one-key shortcuts for commonly used
            profiles. If a profile contains a preference of the form 'key
            = n', where n is a single digit, then pressing this key will
            cause Unison to immediately switch to this profile and begin
            synchronization again from scratch. (Any actions that may
            have been selected for a set of changes currently being
            displayed will be discarded.)
          + Each profile may include a preference 'label = '
            giving a descriptive string that described the options
            selected in this profile. The string is listed along with the
            profile name in the profile selection dialog, and displayed
            in the top-right corner of the main Unison window.
     * Minor:
          + Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the 'diff' display to
            order the files backwards relative to the main user
            interface. (Thanks to Pascal Brisset for this fix.)
          + On Unix systems, the graphical version of Unison will check
            the DISPLAY variable and, if it is not set, automatically
            fall back to the textual user interface.
          + Synchronization paths (path preferences) are now matched
            against the ignore preferences. So if a path is both
            specified in a path preference and ignored, it will be
            skipped.
          + Numerous other bugfixes and small improvements.
       
   Changes since 2.6.1:
     * The synchronization of modification times has been disabled for
       directories.
     * Preference files may now include lines of the form include ,
       which will cause name.prf to be read at that point.
     * The synchronization of permission between Windows and Unix now
       works properly.
     * A binding CYGWIN=binmode in now added to the environment so that
       the Cygwin port of OpenSSH works properly in a non-Cygwin context.
     * The servercmd and addversionno preferences can now be used
       together: -addversionno appends an appropriate -NNN to the server
       command, which is found by using the value of the -servercmd
       preference if there is one, or else just unison.
     * Both '-pref=val' and '-pref val' are now allowed for boolean
       values. (The former can be used to set a preference to false.)
     * Lot of small bugs fixed.
       
   Changes since 2.5.31:
     * The log preference is now set to true by default, since the log
       file seems useful for most users.
     * Several miscellaneous bugfixes (most involving symlinks).
       
   Changes since 2.5.25:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed (again).
     * Several significant bugs introduced in 2.5.25 have been fixed.
       
   Changes since 2.5.1:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * New functionality:
          + Unison now synchronizes file modtimes, user-ids, and
            group-ids.
            These new features are controlled by a set of new
            preferences, all of which are currently false by default.
               o When the times preference is set to true, file
                 modification times are propaged. (Because the
                 representations of time may not have the same
                 granularity on both replicas, Unison may not always be
                 able to make the modtimes precisely equal, but it will
                 get them as close as the operating systems involved
                 allow.)
               o When the owner preference is set to true, file ownership
                 information is synchronized.
               o When the group preference is set to true, group
                 information is synchronized.
               o When the numericIds preference is set to true, owner and
                 group information is synchronized numerically. By
                 default, owner and group numbers are converted to names
                 on each replica and these names are synchronized. (The
                 special user id 0 and the special group 0 are never
                 mapped via user/group names even if this preference is
                 not set.)
          + Added an integer-valued preference perms that can be used to
            control the propagation of permission bits. The value of this
            preference is a mask indicating which permission bits should
            be synchronized. It is set by default to 0o1777: all bits but
            the set-uid and set-gid bits are synchronised (synchronizing
            theses latter bits can be a security hazard). If you want to
            synchronize all bits, you can set the value of this
            preference to -1.
          + Added a log preference (default false), which makes Unison
            keep a complete record of the changes it makes to the
            replicas. By default, this record is written to a file called
            unison.log in the user's home directory (the value of the
            HOME environment variable). If you want it someplace else,
            set the logfile preference to the full pathname you want
            Unison to use.
          + Added an ignorenot preference that maintains a set of
            patterns for paths that should definitely not be ignored,
            whether or not they match an ignore pattern. (That is, a path
            will now be ignored iff it matches an ignore pattern and does
            not match any ignorenot patterns.)
     * User-interface improvements:
          + Roots are now displayed in the user interface in the same
            order as they were given on the command line or in the
            preferences file.
          + When the batch preference is set, the graphical user
            interface no longer waits for user confirmation when it
            displays a warning message: it simply pops up an advisory
            window with a Dismiss button at the bottom and keeps on
            going.
          + Added a new preference for controlling how many status
            messages are printed during update detection: statusdepth
            controls the maximum depth for paths on the local machine
            (longer paths are not displayed, nor are non-directory
            paths). The value should be an integer; default is 1.
          + Removed the trace and silent preferences. They did not seem
            very useful, and there were too many preferences for
            controlling output in various ways.
          + The text UI now displays just the default command (the one
            that will be used if the user just types ) instead of
            all available commands. Typing ? will print the full list of
            possibilities.
          + The function that finds the canonical hostname of the local
            host (which is used, for example, in calculating the name of
            the archive file used to remember which files have been
            synchronized) normally uses the gethostname operating system
            call. However, if the environment variable
            UNISONLOCALHOSTNAME is set, its value will now be used
            instead. This makes it easier to use Unison in situations
            where a machine's name changes frequently (e.g., because it
            is a laptop and gets moved around a lot).
          + File owner and group are now displayed in the ``detail
            window'' at the bottom of the screen, when unison is
            configured to synchronize them.
     * For hackers:
          + Updated to Jacques Garrigue's new version of lablgtk, which
            means we can throw away our local patched version.
            If you're compiling the GTK version of unison from sources,
            you'll need to update your copy of lablgtk to the developers
            release, available from
            http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html
            (Warning: installing lablgtk under Windows is currently a bit
            challenging.)
          + The TODO.txt file (in the source distribution) has been
            cleaned up and reorganized. The list of pending tasks should
            be much easier to make sense of, for people that may want to
            contribute their programming energies. There is also a
            separate file BUGS.txt for open bugs.
          + The Tk user interface has been removed (it was not being
            maintained and no longer compiles).
          + The debug preference now prints quite a bit of additional
            information that should be useful for identifying sources of
            problems.
          + The version number of the remote server is now checked right
            away during the connection setup handshake, rather than
            later. (Somebody sent a bug report of a server crash that
            turned out to come from using inconsistent versions: better
            to check this earlier and in a way that can't crash either
            client or server.)
          + Unison now runs correctly on 64-bit architectures (e.g. Alpha
            linux). We will not be distributing binaries for these
            architectures ourselves (at least for a while) but if someone
            would like to make them available, we'll be glad to provide a
            link to them.
     * Bug fixes:
          + Pattern matching (e.g. for ignore) is now case-insensitive
            when Unison is in case-insensitive mode (i.e., when one of
            the replicas is on a windows machine).
          + Some people had trouble with mysterious failures during
            propagation of updates, where files would be falsely reported
            as having changed during synchronization. This should be
            fixed.
          + Numerous smaller fixes.
       
   Changes since 2.4.1:
     * Added a number of 'sorting modes' for the user interface. By
       default, conflicting changes are displayed at the top, and the
       rest of the entries are sorted in alphabetical order. This
       behavior can be changed in the following ways:
          + Setting the sortnewfirst preference to true causes newly
            created files to be displayed before changed files.
          + Setting sortbysize causes files to be displayed in increasing
            order of size.
          + Giving the preference sortfirst= (where  is
            a path descriptor in the same format as 'ignore' and 'follow'
            patterns, causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed
            first.
          + Similarly, giving the preference sortlast= causes
            paths matching this pattern to be displayed last.
       The sorting preferences are described in more detail in the user
       manual. The sortnewfirst and sortbysize flags can also be accessed
       from the 'Sort' menu in the grpahical user interface.
     * Added two new preferences that can be used to change unison's
       fundamental behavior to make it more like a mirroring tool instead
       of a synchronizer.
          + Giving the preference prefer with argument  (by adding
            -prefer  to the command line or prefer=) to your
            profile) means that, if there is a conflict, the contents of
             should be propagated to the other replica (with no
            questions asked). Non-conflicting changes are treated as
            usual.
          + Giving the preference force with argument  will make
            unison resolve all differences in favor of the given root,
            even if it was the other replica that was changed.
       These options should be used with care! (More information is
       available in the manual.)
     * Small changes:
          + Changed default answer to 'Yes' in all two-button dialogs in
            the graphical interface (this seems more intuitive).
          + The rsync preference has been removed (it was used to
            activate rsync compression for file transfers, but rsync
            compression is now enabled by default).
          + In the text user interface, the arrows indicating which
            direction changes are being propagated are printed
            differently when the user has overridded Unison's default
            recommendation (====> instead of ---->). This matches the
            behavior of the graphical interface, which displays such
            arrows in a different color.
          + Carriage returns (Control-M's) are ignored at the ends of
            lines in profiles, for Windows compatibility.
          + All preferences are now fully documented in the user manual.
       
   Changes since 2.3.12:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * New/improved functionality:
          + A new preference -sortbysize controls the order in which
            changes are displayed to the user: when it is set to true,
            the smallest changed files are displayed first. (The default
            setting is false.)
          + A new preference -sortnewfirst causes newly created files to
            be listed before other updates in the user interface.
          + We now allow the ssh protocol to specify a port.
          + Incompatible change: The unison: protocol is deprecated, and
            we added file: and socket:. You may have to modify your
            profiles in the .unison directory. If a replica is specified
            without an explicit protocol, we now assume it refers to a
            file. (Previously ""//saul/foo"" meant to use SSH to connect to
            saul, then access the foo directory. Now it means to access
            saul via a remote file mechanism such as samba; the old
            effect is now achieved by writing ssh://saul/foo.)
          + Changed the startup sequence for the case where roots are
            given but no profile is given on the command line. The new
            behavior is to use the default profile (creating it if it
            does not exist), and temporarily override its roots. The
            manual claimed that this case would work by reading no
            profile at all, but AFAIK this was never true.
          + In all user interfaces, files with conflicts are always
            listed first
          + A new preference 'sshversion' can be used to control which
            version of ssh should be used to connect to the server. Legal
            values are 1 and 2. (Default is empty, which will make unison
            use whatever version of ssh is installed as the default 'ssh'
            command.)
          + The situation when the permissions of a file was updated the
            same on both side is now handled correctly (we used to report
            a spurious conflict)
     * Improvements for the Windows version:
          + The fact that filenames are treated case-insensitively under
            Windows should now be handled correctly. The exact behavior
            is described in the cross-platform section of the manual.
          + It should be possible to synchronize with Windows shares,
            e.g., //host/drive/path.
          + Workarounds to the bug in syncing root directories in
            Windows. The most difficult thing to fix is an ocaml bug:
            Unix.opendir fails on c: in some versions of Windows.
     * Improvements to the GTK user interface (the Tk interface is no
       longer being maintained):
          + The UI now displays actions differently (in blue) when they
            have been explicitly changed by the user from Unison's
            default recommendation.
          + More colorful appearance.
          + The initial profile selection window works better.
          + If any transfers failed, a message to this effect is
            displayed along with 'Synchronization complete' at the end of
            the transfer phase (in case they may have scrolled off the
            top).
          + Added a global progress meter, displaying the percentage of
            total bytes that have been transferred so far.
     * Improvements to the text user interface:
          + The file details will be displayed automatically when a
            conflict is been detected.
          + when a warning is generated (e.g. for a temporary file left
            over from a previous run of unison) Unison will no longer
            wait for a response if it is running in -batch mode.
          + The UI now displays a short list of possible inputs each time
            it waits for user interaction.
          + The UI now quits immediately (rather than looping back and
            starting the interaction again) if the user presses 'q' when
            asked whether to propagate changes.
          + Pressing 'g' in the text user interface will proceed
            immediately with propagating updates, without asking any more
            questions.
     * Documentation and installation changes:
          + The manual now includes a FAQ, plus sections on common
            problems and on tricks contributed by users.
          + Both the download page and the download directory explicitly
            say what are the current stable and beta-test version
            numbers.
          + The OCaml sources for the up-to-the-minute developers'
            version (not guaranteed to be stable, or even to compile, at
            any given time!) are now available from the download page.
          + Added a subsection to the manual describing cross-platform
            issues (case conflicts, illegal filenames)
     * Many small bug fixes and random improvements.
       
   Changes since 2.3.1:
     * Several bug fixes. The most important is a bug in the rsync module
       that would occasionally cause change propagation to fail with a
       'rename' error.
       
   Changes since 2.2:
     * The multi-threaded transport system is now disabled by default.
       (It is not stable enough yet.)
     * Various bug fixes.
     * A new experimental feature:
       The final component of a -path argument may now be the wildcard
       specifier *. When Unison sees such a path, it expands this path on
       the client into into the corresponding list of paths by listing
       the contents of that directory.
       Note that if you use wildcard paths from the command line, you
       will probably need to use quotes or a backslash to prevent the *
       from being interpreted by your shell.
       If both roots are local, the contents of the first one will be
       used for expanding wildcard paths. (Nb: this is the first one
       after the canonization step -- i.e., the one that is listed first
       in the user interface -- not the one listed first on the command
       line or in the preferences file.)
       
   Changes since 2.1:
     * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation by Sylvain
       Gommier and Norman Ramsey of Tridgell and Mackerras's rsync
       protocol. This protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a
       small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs.
       This feature is mainly helpful for transfers over slow links---on
       fast local area networks it can actually degrade performance---so
       we have left it off by default. Start unison with the -rsync
       option (or put rsync=true in your preferences file) to turn it on.
     * ``Progress bars'' are now diplayed during remote file transfers,
       showing what percentage of each file has been transferred so far.
     * The version numbering scheme has changed. New releases will now be
       have numbers like 2.2.30, where the second component is
       incremented on every significant public release and the third
       component is the ``patch level.''
     * Miscellaneous improvements to the GTK-based user interface.
     * The manual is now available in PDF format.
     * We are experimenting with using a multi-threaded transport
       subsystem to transfer several files at the same time, making much
       more effective use of available network bandwidth. This feature is
       not completely stable yet, so by default it is disabled in the
       release version of Unison.
       If you want to play with the multi-threaded version, you'll need
       to recompile Unison from sources (as described in the
       documentation), setting the THREADS flag in Makefile.OCaml to
       true. Make sure that your OCaml compiler has been installed with
       the -with-pthreads configuration option. (You can verify this by
       checking whether the file threads/threads.cma in the OCaml
       standard library directory contains the string -lpthread near the
       end.)
       
   Changes since 1.292:
     * Reduced memory footprint (this is especially important during the
       first run of unison, where it has to gather information about all
       the files in both repositories).
     * Fixed a bug that would cause the socket server under NT to fail
       after the client exits.
     * Added a SHIFT modifier to the Ignore menu shortcut keys in GTK
       interface (to avoid hitting them accidentally).
       
   Changes since 1.231:
     * Tunneling over ssh is now supported in the Windows version. See
       the installation section of the manual for detailed instructions.
     * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation of the
       rsync protocol, built by Sylvain Gommier and Norman Ramsey. This
       protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of
       a large file has been changed by sending just diffs. The rsync
       feature is off by default in the current version. Use the -rsync
       switch to turn it on. (Nb. We still have a lot of tuning to do:
       you may not notice much speedup yet.)
     * We're experimenting with a multi-threaded transport subsystem,
       written by Jerome Vouillon. The downloadable binaries are still
       single-threaded: if you want to try the multi-threaded version,
       you'll need to recompile from sources. (Say make THREADS=true.)
       Native thread support from the compiler is required. Use the
       option -threads N to select the maximal number of concurrent
       threads (default is 5). Multi-threaded and single-threaded
       clients/servers can interoperate.
     * A new GTK-based user interface is now available, thanks to Jacques
       Garrigue. The Tk user interface still works, but we'll be shifting
       development effort to the GTK interface from now on.
     * OCaml 3.00 is now required for compiling Unison from sources. The
       modules uitk and myfileselect have been changed to use labltk
       instead of camltk. To compile the Tk interface in Windows, you
       must have ocaml-3.00 and tk8.3. When installing tk8.3, put it in
       c:\Tcl rather than the suggested c:\Program Files\Tcl, and be sure
       to install the headers and libraries (which are not installed by
       default).
     * Added a new -addversionno switch, which causes unison to use
       unison- instead of just unison as the remote
       server command. This allows multiple versions of unison to coexist
       conveniently on the same server: whichever version is run on the
       client, the same version will be selected on the server.
       
   Changes since 1.219:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * This version fixes several annoying bugs, including:
          + Some cases where propagation of file permissions was not
            working.
          + umask is now ignored when creating directories
          + directories are create writable, so that a read-only
            directory and its contents can be propagated.
          + Handling of warnings generated by the server.
          + Synchronizing a path whose parent is not a directory on both
            sides is now flagged as erroneous.
          + Fixed some bugs related to symnbolic links and nonexistant
            roots.
               o When a change (deletion or new contents) is propagated
                 onto a 'follow'ed symlink, the file pointed to by the
                 link is now changed. (We used to change the link itself,
                 which doesn't fit our assertion that 'follow' means the
                 link is completely invisible)
               o When one root did not exist, propagating the other root
                 on top of it used to fail, becuase unison could not
                 calculate the working directory into which to write
                 changes. This should be fixed.
     * A human-readable timestamp has been added to Unison's archive
       files.
     * The semantics of Path and Name regular expressions now correspond
       better.
     * Some minor improvements to the text UI (e.g. a command for going
       back to previous items)
     * The organization of the export directory has changed --- should be
       easier to find / download things now.
       
   Changes since 1.200:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * This version has not been tested extensively on Windows.
     * Major internal changes designed to make unison safer to run at the
       same time as the replicas are being changed by the user.
     * Internal performance improvements.
       
   Changes since 1.190:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * A number of internal functions have been changed to reduce the
       amount of memory allocation, especially during the first
       synchronization. This should help power users with very big
       replicas.
     * Reimplementation of low-level remote procedure call stuff, in
       preparation for adding rsync-like smart file transfer in a later
       release.
     * Miscellaneous bug fixes.
       
   Changes since 1.180:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * Fixed some small bugs in the interpretation of ignore patterns.
     * Fixed some problems that were preventing the Windows version from
       working correctly when click-started.
     * Fixes to treatment of file permissions under Windows, which were
       causing spurious reports of different permissions when
       synchronizing between windows and unix systems.
     * Fixed one more non-tail-recursive list processing function, which
       was causing stack overflows when synchronizing very large
       replicas.
       
   Changes since 1.169:
     * The text user interface now provides commands for ignoring files.
     * We found and fixed some more non-tail-recursive list processing
       functions. Some power users have reported success with very large
       replicas.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Files ending in .tmp are no longer ignored
       automatically. If you want to ignore such files, put an
       appropriate ignore pattern in your profile.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The syntax of ignore and follow patterns has
       changed. Instead of putting a line of the form                 ignore = 
       in your profile (.unison/default.prf), you should put:                 ignore = Regexp 
       Moreover, two other styles of pattern are also recognized:                 ignore = Name 
       matches any path in which one component matches , while                 ignore = Path 
       matches exactly the path .
       Standard ``globbing'' conventions can be used in  and
       :
          + a ? matches any single character except /
          + a * matches any sequence of characters not including /
          + [xyz] matches any character from the set {x, y, z }
          + {a,bb,ccc} matches any one of a, bb, or ccc.
       See the user manual for some examples.
       
   Changes since 1.146:
     * Some users were reporting stack overflows when synchronizing huge
       directories. We found and fixed some non-tail-recursive list
       processing functions, which we hope will solve the problem. Please
       give it a try and let us know.
     * Major additions to the documentation.
       
   Changes since 1.142:
     * Major internal tidying and many small bugfixes.
     * Major additions to the user manual.
     * Unison can now be started with no arguments -- it will prompt
       automatically for the name of a profile file containing the roots
       to be synchronized. This makes it possible to start the graphical
       UI from a desktop icon.
     * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such
       signal' exception.
       
   Changes since 1.139:
     * The precompiled windows binary in the last release was compiled
       with an old OCaml compiler, causing propagation of permissions not
       to work (and perhaps leading to some other strange behaviors we've
       heard reports about). This has been corrected. If you're using
       precompiled binaries on Windows, please upgrade.
     * Added a -debug command line flag, which controls debugging of
       various modules. Say -debug XXX to enable debug tracing for module
       XXX, or -debug all to turn on absolutely everything.
     * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such
       signal' exception.
       
   Changes since 1.111:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The names and formats of the preference files
       in the .unison directory have changed. In particular:
          + the file ``prefs'' should be renamed to default.prf
          + the contents of the file ``ignore'' should be merged into
            default.prf. Each line of the form REGEXP in ignore should
            become a line of the form ignore = REGEXP in default.prf.
     * Unison now handles permission bits and symbolic links. See the
       manual for details.
     * You can now have different preference files in your .unison
       directory. If you start unison like this             unison profilename
       (i.e. with just one ``anonymous'' command-line argument), then the
       file ~/.unison/profilename.prf will be loaded instead of
       default.prf.
     * Some improvements to terminal handling in the text user interface
     * Added a switch -killServer that terminates the remote server
       process when the unison client is shutting down, even when using
       sockets for communication. (By default, a remote server created
       using ssh/rsh is terminated automatically, while a socket server
       is left running.)
     * When started in 'socket server' mode, unison prints 'server
       started' on stderr when it is ready to accept connections. (This
       may be useful for scripts that want to tell when a socket-mode
       server has finished initalization.)
     * We now make a nightly mirror of our current internal development
       tree, in case anyone wants an up-to-the-minute version to hack
       around with.
     * Added a file CONTRIB with some suggestions for how to help us make
       Unison better.
       
Changes in Version 2.9.20   Changes since 2.9.1:
     * Added a preference maxthreads that can be used to limit the number
       of simultaneous file transfers.
     * Added a backupdir preference, which controls where backup files
       are stored.
     * Basic support added for OSX. In particular, Unison now recognizes
       when one of the hosts being synchronized is running OSX and
       switches to a case-insensitive treatment of filenames (i.e., 'foo'
       and 'FOO' are considered to be the same file). (OSX is not yet
       fully working, however: in particular, files with resource forks
       will not be synchronized correctly.)
     * The same hash used to form the archive name is now also added to
       the names of the temp files created during file transfer. The
       reason for this is that, during update detection, we are going to
       silently delete any old temp files that we find along the way, and
       we want to prevent ourselves from deleting temp files belonging to
       other instances of Unison that may be running in parallel, e.g.
       synchronizing with a different host. Thanks to Ruslan Ermilov for
       this suggestion.
     * Several small user interface improvements
     * Documentation
          + FAQ and bug reporting instructions have been split out as
            separate HTML pages, accessible directly from the unison web
            page.
          + Additions to FAQ, in particular suggestions about performance
            tuning.
     * Makefile
          + Makefile.OCaml now sets UISTYLE=text or UISTYLE=gtk
            automatically, depending on whether it finds lablgtk
            installed
          + Unison should now compile ``out of the box'' under OSX
       
   Changes since 2.8.1:
     * Changing profile works again under Windows
     * File movement optimization: Unison now tries to use local copy
       instead of transfer for moved or copied files. It is controled by
       a boolean option ``xferbycopying''.
     * Network statistics window (transfer rate, amount of data
       transferred). [NB: not available in Windows-Cygwin version.]
     * symlinks work under the cygwin version (which is dynamically
       linked).
     * Fixed potential deadlock when synchronizing between Windows and
       Unix
     * Small improvements:
          + If neither the
            tt USERPROFILE nor the
            tt HOME environment variables are set, then Unison will put
            its temporary commit log (called
            tt DANGER.README) into the directory named by the
            tt UNISON environment variable, if any; otherwise it will use
            tt C:.
          + alternative set of values for fastcheck: yes = true; no =
            false; default = auto.
          + -silent implies -contactquietly
     * Source code:
          + Code reorganization and tidying. (Started breaking up some of
            the basic utility modules so that the non-unison-specific
            stuff can be made available for other projects.)
          + several Makefile and docs changes (for release);
          + further comments in ``update.ml'';
          + connection information is not stored in global variables
            anymore.
       
   Changes since 2.7.78:
     * Small bugfix to textual user interface under Unix (to avoid
       leaving the terminal in a bad state where it would not echo inputs
       after Unison exited).
       
   Changes since 2.7.39:
     * Improvements to the main web page (stable and beta version docs
       are now both accessible).
     * User manual revised.
     * Added some new preferences:
          + ``sshcmd'' and ``rshcmd'' for specifying paths to ssh and rsh
            programs.
          + ``contactquietly'' for suppressing the ``contacting server''
            message during Unison startup (under the graphical UI).
     * Bug fixes:
          + Fixed small bug in UI that neglected to change the displayed
            column headers if loading a new profile caused the roots to
            change.
          + Fixed a bug that would put the text UI into an infinite loop
            if it encountered a conflict when run in batch mode.
          + Added some code to try to fix the display of non-Ascii
            characters in filenames on Windows systems in the GTK UI.
            (This code is currently untested---if you're one of the
            people that had reported problems with display of non-ascii
            filenames, we'd appreciate knowing if this actually fixes
            things.)
          + `-prefer/-force newer' works properly now. (The bug was
            reported by Sebastian Urbaniak and Sean Fulton.)
     * User interface and Unison behavior:
          + Renamed `Proceed' to `Go' in the graphical UI.
          + Added exit status for the textual user interface.
          + Paths that are not synchronized because of conflicts or
            errors during update detection are now noted in the log file.
          + [END] messages in log now use a briefer format
          + Changed the text UI startup sequence so that
            tt ./unison -ui text will use the default profile instead of
            failing.
          + Made some improvements to the error messages.
          + Added some debugging messages to remote.ml.
       
   Changes since 2.7.7:
     * Incorporated, once again, a multi-threaded transport sub-system.
       It transfers several files at the same time, thereby making much
       more effective use of available network bandwidth. Unlike the
       earlier attempt, this time we do not rely on the native thread
       library of OCaml. Instead, we implement a light-weight,
       non-preemptive multi-thread library in OCaml directly. This
       version appears stable.
       Some adjustments to unison are made to accommodate the
       multi-threaded version. These include, in particular, changes to
       the user interface and logging, for example:
          + Two log entries for each transferring task, one for the
            beginning, one for the end.
          + Suppressed warning messages against removing temp files left
            by a previous unison run, because warning does not work
            nicely under multi-threading. The temp file names are made
            less likely to coincide with the name of a file created by
            the user. They take the form
            .#..unison.tmp.
     * Added a new command to the GTK user interface: pressing 'f' causes
       Unison to start a new update detection phase, using as paths just
       those paths that have been detected as changed and not yet marked
       as successfully completed. Use this command to quickly restart
       Unison on just the set of paths still needing attention after a
       previous run.
     * Made the ignorecase preference user-visible, and changed the
       initialization code so that it can be manually set to true, even
       if neither host is running Windows. (This may be useful, e.g.,
       when using Unison running on a Unix system with a FAT volume
       mounted.)
     * Small improvements and bug fixes:
          + Errors in preference files now generate fatal errors rather
            than warnings at startup time. (I.e., you can't go on from
            them.) Also, we fixed a bug that was preventing these
            warnings from appearing in the text UI, so some users who
            have been running (unsuspectingly) with garbage in their
            prefs files may now get error reports.
          + Error reporting for preference files now provides file name
            and line number.
          + More intelligible message in the case of identical change to
            the same files: ``Nothing to do: replicas have been changed
            only in identical ways since last sync.''
          + Files with prefix '.#' excluded when scanning for preference
            files.
          + Rsync instructions are send directly instead of first
            marshaled.
          + Won't try forever to get the fingerprint of a continuously
            changing file: unison will give up after certain number of
            retries.
          + Other bug fixes, including the one reported by Peter Selinger
            (force=older preference not working).
     * Compilation:
          + Upgraded to the new OCaml 3.04 compiler, with the LablGtk
            1.2.3 library (patched version used for compiling under
            Windows).
          + Added the option to compile unison on the Windows platform
            with Cygwin GNU C compiler. This option only supports
            building dynamically linked unison executables.
       
   Changes since 2.7.4:
     * Fixed a silly (but debilitating) bug in the client startup
       sequence.
       
   Changes since 2.7.1:
     * Added addprefsto preference, which (when set) controls which
       preference file new preferences (e.g. new ignore patterns) are
       added to.
     * Bug fix: read the initial connection header one byte at a time, so
       that we don't block if the header is shorter than expected. (This
       bug did not affect normal operation --- it just made it hard to
       tell when you were trying to use Unison incorrectly with an old
       version of the server, since it would hang instead of giving an
       error message.)
       
   Changes since 2.6.59:
     * Changed fastcheck from a boolean to a string preference. Its legal
       values are yes (for a fast check), no (for a safe check), or
       default (for a fast check---which also happens to be safe---when
       running on Unix and a safe check when on Windows). The default is
       default.
     * Several preferences have been renamed for consistency. All
       preference names are now spelled out in lowercase. For backward
       compatibility, the old names still work, but they are not
       mentioned in the manual any more.
     * The temp files created by the 'diff' and 'merge' commands are now
       named by prepending a new prefix to the file name, rather than
       appending a suffix. This should avoid confusing diff/merge
       programs that depend on the suffix to guess the type of the file
       contents.
     * We now set the keepalive option on the server socket, to make sure
       that the server times out if the communication link is
       unexpectedly broken.
     * Bug fixes:
          + When updating small files, Unison now closes the destination
            file.
          + File permissions are properly updated when the file is behind
            a followed link.
          + Several other small fixes.
       
   Changes since 2.6.38:
     * Major Windows performance improvement!
       We've added a preference fastcheck that makes Unison look only at
       a file's creation time and last-modified time to check whether it
       has changed. This should result in a huge speedup when checking
       for updates in large replicas.
       When this switch is set, Unison will use file creation times as
       'pseudo inode numbers' when scanning Windows replicas for updates,
       instead of reading the full contents of every file. This may cause
       Unison to miss propagating an update if the create time,
       modification time, and length of the file are all unchanged by the
       update (this is not easy to achieve, but it can be done). However,
       Unison will never overwrite such an update with a change from the
       other replica, since it always does a safe check for updates just
       before propagating a change. Thus, it is reasonable to use this
       switch most of the time and occasionally run Unison once with
       fastcheck set to false, if you are worried that Unison may have
       overlooked an update.
       Warning: This change is has not yet been thoroughly field-tested.
       If you set the fastcheck preference, pay careful attention to what
       Unison is doing.
     * New functionality: centralized backups and merging
          + This version incorporates two pieces of major new
            functionality, implemented by Sylvain Roy during a summer
            internship at Penn: a centralized backup facility that keeps
            a full backup of (selected files in) each replica, and a
            merging feature that allows Unison to invoke an external
            file-merging tool to resolve conflicting changes to
            individual files.
          + Centralized backups:
               o Unison now maintains full backups of the
                 last-synchronized versions of (some of) the files in
                 each replica; these function both as backups in the
                 usual sense and as the ``common version'' when invoking
                 external merge programs.
               o The backed up files are stored in a directory
                 /.unison/backup on each host. (The name of this
                 directory can be changed by setting the environment
                 variable UNISONBACKUPDIR.)
               o The predicate backup controls which files are actually
                 backed up: giving the preference 'backup = Path *'
                 causes backing up of all files.
               o Files are added to the backup directory whenever unison
                 updates its archive. This means that
                    # When unison reconstructs its archive from scratch
                      (e.g., because of an upgrade, or because the
                      archive files have been manually deleted), all
                      files will be backed up.
                    # Otherwise, each file will be backed up the first
                      time unison propagates an update for it.
               o The preference backupversions controls how many previous
                 versions of each file are kept. The default is 2 (i.e.,
                 the last synchronized version plus one backup).
               o For backward compatibility, the backups preference is
                 also still supported, but backup is now preferred.
               o It is OK to manually delete files from the backup
                 directory (or to throw away the directory itself).
                 Before unison uses any of these files for anything
                 important, it checks that its fingerprint matches the
                 one that it expects.
          + Merging:
               o Both user interfaces offer a new 'merge' command,
                 invoked by pressing 'm' (with a changed file selected).
               o The actual merging is performed by an external program.
                 The preferences merge and merge2 control how this
                 program is invoked. If a backup exists for this file
                 (see the backup preference), then the merge preference
                 is used for this purpose; otherwise merge2 is used. In
                 both cases, the value of the preference should be a
                 string representing the command that should be passed to
                 a shell to invoke the merge program. Within this string,
                 the special substrings CURRENT1, CURRENT2, NEW, and OLD
                 may appear at any point. Unison will substitute these as
                 follows before invoking the command:
                    # CURRENT1 is replaced by the name of the local copy
                      of the file;
                    # CURRENT2 is replaced by the name of a temporary
                      file, into which the contents of the remote copy of
                      the file have been transferred by Unison prior to
                      performing the merge;
                    # NEW is replaced by the name of a temporary file
                      that Unison expects to be written by the merge
                      program when it finishes, giving the desired new
                      contents of the file; and
                    # OLD is replaced by the name of the backed up copy
                      of the original version of the file (i.e., its
                      state at the end of the last successful run of
                      Unison), if one exists (applies only to merge, not
                      merge2).
                 For example, on Unix systems setting the merge
                 preference to   merge = diff3 -m CURRENT1 OLD CURRENT2 > NEW
                 will tell Unison to use the external diff3 program for
                 merging.
                 A large number of external merging programs are
                 available. For example, emacs users may find the
                 following convenient:    merge2 = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2""
               nil ""NEW"")'
    merge = emacs -q --eval '(ediff-merge-files-with-ancestor
               ""CURRENT1"" ""CURRENT2"" ""OLD"" nil ""NEW"")'
                 (These commands are displayed here on two lines to avoid
                 running off the edge of the page. In your preference
                 file, each should be written on a single line.)
               o If the external program exits without leaving any file
                 at the path NEW, Unison considers the merge to have
                 failed. If the merge program writes a file called NEW
                 but exits with a non-zero status code, then Unison
                 considers the merge to have succeeded but to have
                 generated conflicts. In this case, it attempts to invoke
                 an external editor so that the user can resolve the
                 conflicts. The value of the editor preference controls
                 what editor is invoked by Unison. The default is emacs.
               o Please send us suggestions for other useful values of
                 the merge2 and merge preferences -- we'd like to give
                 several examples in the manual.
     * Smaller changes:
          + When one preference file includes another, unison no longer
            adds the suffix '.prf' to the included file by default. If a
            file with precisely the given name exists in the .unison
            directory, it will be used; otherwise Unison will add .prf,
            as it did before. (This change means that included preference
            files can be named blah.include instead of blah.prf, so that
            unison will not offer them in its 'choose a preference file'
            dialog.)
          + For Linux systems, we now offer both a statically linked and
            a dynamically linked executable. The static one is larger,
            but will probably run on more systems, since it doesn't
            depend on the same versions of dynamically linked library
            modules being available.
          + Fixed the force and prefer preferences, which were getting
            the propagation direction exactly backwards.
          + Fixed a bug in the startup code that would cause unison to
            crash when the default profile (~/.unison/default.prf) does
            not exist.
          + Fixed a bug where, on the run when a profile is first
            created, Unison would confusingly display the roots in
            reverse order in the user interface.
     * For developers:
          + We've added a module dependency diagram to the source
            distribution, in src/DEPENDENCIES.ps, to help new prospective
            developers with navigating the code.
       
   Changes since 2.6.11:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The startup sequence has been completely
       rewritten and greatly simplified. The main user-visible change is
       that the defaultpath preference has been removed. Its effect can
       be approximated by using multiple profiles, with include
       directives to incorporate common settings. All uses of defaultpath
       in existing profiles should be changed to path.
       Another change in startup behavior that will affect some users is
       that it is no longer possible to specify roots both in the profile
       and on the command line.
       You can achieve a similar effect, though, by breaking your profile
       into two:
  default.prf =
      root = blah
      root = foo
      include common  common.prf =
      
       Now do  unison common root1 root2
       when you want to specify roots explicitly.
     * The -prefer and -force options have been extended to allow users
       to specify that files with more recent modtimes should be
       propagated, writing either -prefer newer or -force newer. (For
       symmetry, Unison will also accept -prefer older or -force older.)
       The -force older/newer options can only be used when -times is
       also set.
       The graphical user interface provides access to these facilities
       on a one-off basis via the Actions menu.
     * Names of roots can now be ``aliased'' to allow replicas to be
       relocated without changing the name of the archive file where
       Unison stores information between runs. (This feature is for
       experts only. See the ``Archive Files'' section of the manual for
       more information.)
     * Graphical user-interface:
          + A new command is provided in the Synchronization menu for
            switching to a new profile without restarting Unison from
            scratch.
          + The GUI also supports one-key shortcuts for commonly used
            profiles. If a profile contains a preference of the form 'key
            = n', where n is a single digit, then pressing this key will
            cause Unison to immediately switch to this profile and begin
            synchronization again from scratch. (Any actions that may
            have been selected for a set of changes currently being
            displayed will be discarded.)
          + Each profile may include a preference 'label = '
            giving a descriptive string that described the options
            selected in this profile. The string is listed along with the
            profile name in the profile selection dialog, and displayed
            in the top-right corner of the main Unison window.
     * Minor:
          + Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the 'diff' display to
            order the files backwards relative to the main user
            interface. (Thanks to Pascal Brisset for this fix.)
          + On Unix systems, the graphical version of Unison will check
            the DISPLAY variable and, if it is not set, automatically
            fall back to the textual user interface.
          + Synchronization paths (path preferences) are now matched
            against the ignore preferences. So if a path is both
            specified in a path preference and ignored, it will be
            skipped.
          + Numerous other bugfixes and small improvements.
       
   Changes since 2.6.1:
     * The synchronization of modification times has been disabled for
       directories.
     * Preference files may now include lines of the form include ,
       which will cause name.prf to be read at that point.
     * The synchronization of permission between Windows and Unix now
       works properly.
     * A binding CYGWIN=binmode in now added to the environment so that
       the Cygwin port of OpenSSH works properly in a non-Cygwin context.
     * The servercmd and addversionno preferences can now be used
       together: -addversionno appends an appropriate -NNN to the server
       command, which is found by using the value of the -servercmd
       preference if there is one, or else just unison.
     * Both '-pref=val' and '-pref val' are now allowed for boolean
       values. (The former can be used to set a preference to false.)
     * Lot of small bugs fixed.
       
   Changes since 2.5.31:
     * The log preference is now set to true by default, since the log
       file seems useful for most users.
     * Several miscellaneous bugfixes (most involving symlinks).
       
   Changes since 2.5.25:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed (again).
     * Several significant bugs introduced in 2.5.25 have been fixed.
       
   Changes since 2.5.1:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * New functionality:
          + Unison now synchronizes file modtimes, user-ids, and
            group-ids.
            These new features are controlled by a set of new
            preferences, all of which are currently false by default.
               o When the times preference is set to true, file
                 modification times are propaged. (Because the
                 representations of time may not have the same
                 granularity on both replicas, Unison may not always be
                 able to make the modtimes precisely equal, but it will
                 get them as close as the operating systems involved
                 allow.)
               o When the owner preference is set to true, file ownership
                 information is synchronized.
               o When the group preference is set to true, group
                 information is synchronized.
               o When the numericIds preference is set to true, owner and
                 group information is synchronized numerically. By
                 default, owner and group numbers are converted to names
                 on each replica and these names are synchronized. (The
                 special user id 0 and the special group 0 are never
                 mapped via user/group names even if this preference is
                 not set.)
          + Added an integer-valued preference perms that can be used to
            control the propagation of permission bits. The value of this
            preference is a mask indicating which permission bits should
            be synchronized. It is set by default to 0o1777: all bits but
            the set-uid and set-gid bits are synchronised (synchronizing
            theses latter bits can be a security hazard). If you want to
            synchronize all bits, you can set the value of this
            preference to -1.
          + Added a log preference (default false), which makes Unison
            keep a complete record of the changes it makes to the
            replicas. By default, this record is written to a file called
            unison.log in the user's home directory (the value of the
            HOME environment variable). If you want it someplace else,
            set the logfile preference to the full pathname you want
            Unison to use.
          + Added an ignorenot preference that maintains a set of
            patterns for paths that should definitely not be ignored,
            whether or not they match an ignore pattern. (That is, a path
            will now be ignored iff it matches an ignore pattern and does
            not match any ignorenot patterns.)
     * User-interface improvements:
          + Roots are now displayed in the user interface in the same
            order as they were given on the command line or in the
            preferences file.
          + When the batch preference is set, the graphical user
            interface no longer waits for user confirmation when it
            displays a warning message: it simply pops up an advisory
            window with a Dismiss button at the bottom and keeps on
            going.
          + Added a new preference for controlling how many status
            messages are printed during update detection: statusdepth
            controls the maximum depth for paths on the local machine
            (longer paths are not displayed, nor are non-directory
            paths). The value should be an integer; default is 1.
          + Removed the trace and silent preferences. They did not seem
            very useful, and there were too many preferences for
            controlling output in various ways.
          + The text UI now displays just the default command (the one
            that will be used if the user just types ) instead of
            all available commands. Typing ? will print the full list of
            possibilities.
          + The function that finds the canonical hostname of the local
            host (which is used, for example, in calculating the name of
            the archive file used to remember which files have been
            synchronized) normally uses the gethostname operating system
            call. However, if the environment variable
            UNISONLOCALHOSTNAME is set, its value will now be used
            instead. This makes it easier to use Unison in situations
            where a machine's name changes frequently (e.g., because it
            is a laptop and gets moved around a lot).
          + File owner and group are now displayed in the ``detail
            window'' at the bottom of the screen, when unison is
            configured to synchronize them.
     * For hackers:
          + Updated to Jacques Garrigue's new version of lablgtk, which
            means we can throw away our local patched version.
            If you're compiling the GTK version of unison from sources,
            you'll need to update your copy of lablgtk to the developers
            release, available from
            http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html
            (Warning: installing lablgtk under Windows is currently a bit
            challenging.)
          + The TODO.txt file (in the source distribution) has been
            cleaned up and reorganized. The list of pending tasks should
            be much easier to make sense of, for people that may want to
            contribute their programming energies. There is also a
            separate file BUGS.txt for open bugs.
          + The Tk user interface has been removed (it was not being
            maintained and no longer compiles).
          + The debug preference now prints quite a bit of additional
            information that should be useful for identifying sources of
            problems.
          + The version number of the remote server is now checked right
            away during the connection setup handshake, rather than
            later. (Somebody sent a bug report of a server crash that
            turned out to come from using inconsistent versions: better
            to check this earlier and in a way that can't crash either
            client or server.)
          + Unison now runs correctly on 64-bit architectures (e.g. Alpha
            linux). We will not be distributing binaries for these
            architectures ourselves (at least for a while) but if someone
            would like to make them available, we'll be glad to provide a
            link to them.
     * Bug fixes:
          + Pattern matching (e.g. for ignore) is now case-insensitive
            when Unison is in case-insensitive mode (i.e., when one of
            the replicas is on a windows machine).
          + Some people had trouble with mysterious failures during
            propagation of updates, where files would be falsely reported
            as having changed during synchronization. This should be
            fixed.
          + Numerous smaller fixes.
       
   Changes since 2.4.1:
     * Added a number of 'sorting modes' for the user interface. By
       default, conflicting changes are displayed at the top, and the
       rest of the entries are sorted in alphabetical order. This
       behavior can be changed in the following ways:
          + Setting the sortnewfirst preference to true causes newly
            created files to be displayed before changed files.
          + Setting sortbysize causes files to be displayed in increasing
            order of size.
          + Giving the preference sortfirst= (where  is
            a path descriptor in the same format as 'ignore' and 'follow'
            patterns, causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed
            first.
          + Similarly, giving the preference sortlast= causes
            paths matching this pattern to be displayed last.
       The sorting preferences are described in more detail in the user
       manual. The sortnewfirst and sortbysize flags can also be accessed
       from the 'Sort' menu in the grpahical user interface.
     * Added two new preferences that can be used to change unison's
       fundamental behavior to make it more like a mirroring tool instead
       of a synchronizer.
          + Giving the preference prefer with argument  (by adding
            -prefer  to the command line or prefer=) to your
            profile) means that, if there is a conflict, the contents of
             should be propagated to the other replica (with no
            questions asked). Non-conflicting changes are treated as
            usual.
          + Giving the preference force with argument  will make
            unison resolve all differences in favor of the given root,
            even if it was the other replica that was changed.
       These options should be used with care! (More information is
       available in the manual.)
     * Small changes:
          + Changed default answer to 'Yes' in all two-button dialogs in
            the graphical interface (this seems more intuitive).
          + The rsync preference has been removed (it was used to
            activate rsync compression for file transfers, but rsync
            compression is now enabled by default).
          + In the text user interface, the arrows indicating which
            direction changes are being propagated are printed
            differently when the user has overridded Unison's default
            recommendation (====> instead of ---->). This matches the
            behavior of the graphical interface, which displays such
            arrows in a different color.
          + Carriage returns (Control-M's) are ignored at the ends of
            lines in profiles, for Windows compatibility.
          + All preferences are now fully documented in the user manual.
       
   Changes since 2.3.12:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * New/improved functionality:
          + A new preference -sortbysize controls the order in which
            changes are displayed to the user: when it is set to true,
            the smallest changed files are displayed first. (The default
            setting is false.)
          + A new preference -sortnewfirst causes newly created files to
            be listed before other updates in the user interface.
          + We now allow the ssh protocol to specify a port.
          + Incompatible change: The unison: protocol is deprecated, and
            we added file: and socket:. You may have to modify your
            profiles in the .unison directory. If a replica is specified
            without an explicit protocol, we now assume it refers to a
            file. (Previously ""//saul/foo"" meant to use SSH to connect to
            saul, then access the foo directory. Now it means to access
            saul via a remote file mechanism such as samba; the old
            effect is now achieved by writing ssh://saul/foo.)
          + Changed the startup sequence for the case where roots are
            given but no profile is given on the command line. The new
            behavior is to use the default profile (creating it if it
            does not exist), and temporarily override its roots. The
            manual claimed that this case would work by reading no
            profile at all, but AFAIK this was never true.
          + In all user interfaces, files with conflicts are always
            listed first
          + A new preference 'sshversion' can be used to control which
            version of ssh should be used to connect to the server. Legal
            values are 1 and 2. (Default is empty, which will make unison
            use whatever version of ssh is installed as the default 'ssh'
            command.)
          + The situation when the permissions of a file was updated the
            same on both side is now handled correctly (we used to report
            a spurious conflict)
     * Improvements for the Windows version:
          + The fact that filenames are treated case-insensitively under
            Windows should now be handled correctly. The exact behavior
            is described in the cross-platform section of the manual.
          + It should be possible to synchronize with Windows shares,
            e.g., //host/drive/path.
          + Workarounds to the bug in syncing root directories in
            Windows. The most difficult thing to fix is an ocaml bug:
            Unix.opendir fails on c: in some versions of Windows.
     * Improvements to the GTK user interface (the Tk interface is no
       longer being maintained):
          + The UI now displays actions differently (in blue) when they
            have been explicitly changed by the user from Unison's
            default recommendation.
          + More colorful appearance.
          + The initial profile selection window works better.
          + If any transfers failed, a message to this effect is
            displayed along with 'Synchronization complete' at the end of
            the transfer phase (in case they may have scrolled off the
            top).
          + Added a global progress meter, displaying the percentage of
            total bytes that have been transferred so far.
     * Improvements to the text user interface:
          + The file details will be displayed automatically when a
            conflict is been detected.
          + when a warning is generated (e.g. for a temporary file left
            over from a previous run of unison) Unison will no longer
            wait for a response if it is running in -batch mode.
          + The UI now displays a short list of possible inputs each time
            it waits for user interaction.
          + The UI now quits immediately (rather than looping back and
            starting the interaction again) if the user presses 'q' when
            asked whether to propagate changes.
          + Pressing 'g' in the text user interface will proceed
            immediately with propagating updates, without asking any more
            questions.
     * Documentation and installation changes:
          + The manual now includes a FAQ, plus sections on common
            problems and on tricks contributed by users.
          + Both the download page and the download directory explicitly
            say what are the current stable and beta-test version
            numbers.
          + The OCaml sources for the up-to-the-minute developers'
            version (not guaranteed to be stable, or even to compile, at
            any given time!) are now available from the download page.
          + Added a subsection to the manual describing cross-platform
            issues (case conflicts, illegal filenames)
     * Many small bug fixes and random improvements.
       
   Changes since 2.3.1:
     * Several bug fixes. The most important is a bug in the rsync module
       that would occasionally cause change propagation to fail with a
       'rename' error.
       
   Changes since 2.2:
     * The multi-threaded transport system is now disabled by default.
       (It is not stable enough yet.)
     * Various bug fixes.
     * A new experimental feature:
       The final component of a -path argument may now be the wildcard
       specifier *. When Unison sees such a path, it expands this path on
       the client into into the corresponding list of paths by listing
       the contents of that directory.
       Note that if you use wildcard paths from the command line, you
       will probably need to use quotes or a backslash to prevent the *
       from being interpreted by your shell.
       If both roots are local, the contents of the first one will be
       used for expanding wildcard paths. (Nb: this is the first one
       after the canonization step -- i.e., the one that is listed first
       in the user interface -- not the one listed first on the command
       line or in the preferences file.)
       
   Changes since 2.1:
     * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation by Sylvain
       Gommier and Norman Ramsey of Tridgell and Mackerras's rsync
       protocol. This protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a
       small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs.
       This feature is mainly helpful for transfers over slow links---on
       fast local area networks it can actually degrade performance---so
       we have left it off by default. Start unison with the -rsync
       option (or put rsync=true in your preferences file) to turn it on.
     * ``Progress bars'' are now diplayed during remote file transfers,
       showing what percentage of each file has been transferred so far.
     * The version numbering scheme has changed. New releases will now be
       have numbers like 2.2.30, where the second component is
       incremented on every significant public release and the third
       component is the ``patch level.''
     * Miscellaneous improvements to the GTK-based user interface.
     * The manual is now available in PDF format.
     * We are experimenting with using a multi-threaded transport
       subsystem to transfer several files at the same time, making much
       more effective use of available network bandwidth. This feature is
       not completely stable yet, so by default it is disabled in the
       release version of Unison.
       If you want to play with the multi-threaded version, you'll need
       to recompile Unison from sources (as described in the
       documentation), setting the THREADS flag in Makefile.OCaml to
       true. Make sure that your OCaml compiler has been installed with
       the -with-pthreads configuration option. (You can verify this by
       checking whether the file threads/threads.cma in the OCaml
       standard library directory contains the string -lpthread near the
       end.)
       
   Changes since 1.292:
     * Reduced memory footprint (this is especially important during the
       first run of unison, where it has to gather information about all
       the files in both repositories).
     * Fixed a bug that would cause the socket server under NT to fail
       after the client exits.
     * Added a SHIFT modifier to the Ignore menu shortcut keys in GTK
       interface (to avoid hitting them accidentally).
       
   Changes since 1.231:
     * Tunneling over ssh is now supported in the Windows version. See
       the installation section of the manual for detailed instructions.
     * The transport subsystem now includes an implementation of the
       rsync protocol, built by Sylvain Gommier and Norman Ramsey. This
       protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of
       a large file has been changed by sending just diffs. The rsync
       feature is off by default in the current version. Use the -rsync
       switch to turn it on. (Nb. We still have a lot of tuning to do:
       you may not notice much speedup yet.)
     * We're experimenting with a multi-threaded transport subsystem,
       written by Jerome Vouillon. The downloadable binaries are still
       single-threaded: if you want to try the multi-threaded version,
       you'll need to recompile from sources. (Say make THREADS=true.)
       Native thread support from the compiler is required. Use the
       option -threads N to select the maximal number of concurrent
       threads (default is 5). Multi-threaded and single-threaded
       clients/servers can interoperate.
     * A new GTK-based user interface is now available, thanks to Jacques
       Garrigue. The Tk user interface still works, but we'll be shifting
       development effort to the GTK interface from now on.
     * OCaml 3.00 is now required for compiling Unison from sources. The
       modules uitk and myfileselect have been changed to use labltk
       instead of camltk. To compile the Tk interface in Windows, you
       must have ocaml-3.00 and tk8.3. When installing tk8.3, put it in
       c:\Tcl rather than the suggested c:\Program Files\Tcl, and be sure
       to install the headers and libraries (which are not installed by
       default).
     * Added a new -addversionno switch, which causes unison to use
       unison- instead of just unison as the remote
       server command. This allows multiple versions of unison to coexist
       conveniently on the same server: whichever version is run on the
       client, the same version will be selected on the server.
       
   Changes since 1.219:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * This version fixes several annoying bugs, including:
          + Some cases where propagation of file permissions was not
            working.
          + umask is now ignored when creating directories
          + directories are create writable, so that a read-only
            directory and its contents can be propagated.
          + Handling of warnings generated by the server.
          + Synchronizing a path whose parent is not a directory on both
            sides is now flagged as erroneous.
          + Fixed some bugs related to symnbolic links and nonexistant
            roots.
               o When a change (deletion or new contents) is propagated
                 onto a 'follow'ed symlink, the file pointed to by the
                 link is now changed. (We used to change the link itself,
                 which doesn't fit our assertion that 'follow' means the
                 link is completely invisible)
               o When one root did not exist, propagating the other root
                 on top of it used to fail, becuase unison could not
                 calculate the working directory into which to write
                 changes. This should be fixed.
     * A human-readable timestamp has been added to Unison's archive
       files.
     * The semantics of Path and Name regular expressions now correspond
       better.
     * Some minor improvements to the text UI (e.g. a command for going
       back to previous items)
     * The organization of the export directory has changed --- should be
       easier to find / download things now.
       
   Changes since 1.200:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * This version has not been tested extensively on Windows.
     * Major internal changes designed to make unison safer to run at the
       same time as the replicas are being changed by the user.
     * Internal performance improvements.
       
   Changes since 1.190:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * A number of internal functions have been changed to reduce the
       amount of memory allocation, especially during the first
       synchronization. This should help power users with very big
       replicas.
     * Reimplementation of low-level remote procedure call stuff, in
       preparation for adding rsync-like smart file transfer in a later
       release.
     * Miscellaneous bug fixes.
       
   Changes since 1.180:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Archive format has changed. Make sure you
       synchronize your replicas before upgrading, to avoid spurious
       conflicts. The first sync after upgrading will be slow.
     * Fixed some small bugs in the interpretation of ignore patterns.
     * Fixed some problems that were preventing the Windows version from
       working correctly when click-started.
     * Fixes to treatment of file permissions under Windows, which were
       causing spurious reports of different permissions when
       synchronizing between windows and unix systems.
     * Fixed one more non-tail-recursive list processing function, which
       was causing stack overflows when synchronizing very large
       replicas.
       
   Changes since 1.169:
     * The text user interface now provides commands for ignoring files.
     * We found and fixed some more non-tail-recursive list processing
       functions. Some power users have reported success with very large
       replicas.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Files ending in .tmp are no longer ignored
       automatically. If you want to ignore such files, put an
       appropriate ignore pattern in your profile.
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The syntax of ignore and follow patterns has
       changed. Instead of putting a line of the form                 ignore = 
       in your profile (.unison/default.prf), you should put:                 ignore = Regexp 
       Moreover, two other styles of pattern are also recognized:                 ignore = Name 
       matches any path in which one component matches , while                 ignore = Path 
       matches exactly the path .
       Standard ``globbing'' conventions can be used in  and
       :
          + a ? matches any single character except /
          + a * matches any sequence of characters not including /
          + [xyz] matches any character from the set {x, y, z }
          + {a,bb,ccc} matches any one of a, bb, or ccc.
       See the user manual for some examples.
       
   Changes since 1.146:
     * Some users were reporting stack overflows when synchronizing huge
       directories. We found and fixed some non-tail-recursive list
       processing functions, which we hope will solve the problem. Please
       give it a try and let us know.
     * Major additions to the documentation.
       
   Changes since 1.142:
     * Major internal tidying and many small bugfixes.
     * Major additions to the user manual.
     * Unison can now be started with no arguments -- it will prompt
       automatically for the name of a profile file containing the roots
       to be synchronized. This makes it possible to start the graphical
       UI from a desktop icon.
     * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such
       signal' exception.
       
   Changes since 1.139:
     * The precompiled windows binary in the last release was compiled
       with an old OCaml compiler, causing propagation of permissions not
       to work (and perhaps leading to some other strange behaviors we've
       heard reports about). This has been corrected. If you're using
       precompiled binaries on Windows, please upgrade.
     * Added a -debug command line flag, which controls debugging of
       various modules. Say -debug XXX to enable debug tracing for module
       XXX, or -debug all to turn on absolutely everything.
     * Fixed a small bug where the text UI on NT was raising a 'no such
       signal' exception.
       
   Changes since 1.111:
     * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The names and formats of the preference files
       in the .unison directory have changed. In particular:
          + the file ``prefs'' should be renamed to default.prf
          + the contents of the file ``ignore'' should be merged into
            default.prf. Each line of the form REGEXP in ignore should
            become a line of the form ignore = REGEXP in default.prf.
     * Unison now handles permission bits and symbolic links. See the
       manual for details.
     * You can now have different preference files in your .unison
       directory. If you start unison like this             unison profilename
       (i.e. with just one ``anonymous'' command-line argument), then the
       file ~/.unison/profilename.prf will be loaded instead of
       default.prf.
     * Some improvements to terminal handling in the text user interface
     * Added a switch -killServer that terminates the remote server
       process when the unison client is shutting down, even when using
       sockets for communication. (By default, a remote server created
       using ssh/rsh is terminated automatically, while a socket server
       is left running.)
     * When started in 'socket server' mode, unison prints 'server
       started' on stderr when it is ready to accept connections. (This
       may be useful for scripts that want to tell when a socket-mode
       server has finished initalization.)
     * We now make a nightly mirror of our current internal development
       tree, in case anyone wants an up-to-the-minute version to hack
       around with.
     * Added a file CONTRIB with some suggestions for how to help us make
       Unison better.

"Hiya folks,I'm currently running RawHide, since I had the brilliant idea that, by
using APT, it might actually be practical to keep up with the
developments.However, APT seems to want a recompile - its sometimes leaving the RPM
database in need of a db_recover - and gcc 3.2 seems to require a closer
adherence to the standard than the C++ in APT was written for.This is a bit of a bummer.Does anyone know if there's a latest version I could try which might
work, or whether I should simply do the porting myself? (I've made a
start, but there's a fair amount of work to do.)If this works out, I might start a repository for the freshrpms compiled
on vLatest RawHide, for my own purposes and anyone else who's
interested.Dave._______________________________________________

"query : latin and romance the following hypothetical question has arisen in connection with what is possibly a real case of the same sort , but in another domain . suppose that latin had only occasionally been written down , and suppose that all latin texts , and indeed all knowledge of latin , had been totally lost long ago , apart perhaps from the odd place name or personal name , now of unknown significance . suppose further that only a single romance language had survived down to the present day - - say , galician , or gascon , or sicilian - - and that this variety had been written down for no more than four centuries and had never acquired any learned words from latin . in fact , to be on the safe side , let 's assume that the entire indo - european family had died out apart from this one romance language . now , suppose that a few fairly substantial latin texts happened to be dug up somewhere , none of them longer than about fifty words , with word-boundaries not systematically marked and the subject matter unknown ; these might have been written down over several centuries , but in no case later than the first century bc . knowing the alphabet , we would be able to read them at the phonological level , at least roughly , but at first the language would be utterly mysterious . so here 's my question . would it be possible for specialists in that last surviving romance language to establish that the recovered texts in fact represented an archaic form of that language , and would they be able to use their knowledge to interpret ( at least in part ) the texts themselves ? if anything turns up , i ' ll summarize the responses and explain what the point of this admittedly curious inquiry is . i ' m sending this query to both the linguist list and the ie list ; my apologies to those who receive it twice . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk",0,Safe,zefang_phishing_email_dataset,0,email,True

Date: Not suppliedJakob Nielsen on Offshore Usability[1]: ""To save costs, some companies are 
outsourcing Web projects to countries with cheap labor. Unfortunately, these 
countries lack strong usability traditions and their developers have limited 
access -- if any -- to good usability data from the target users."" Offshore usability is a specific case of the general ""offshore design"" problem. 
Put simply, software teams are not successful when 
design or management are done in a different physical location than 
programming. Once I actually had a job where I was in New York, my direct 
manager was in Singapore, _his_ manager was in Hyderabad, and if I needed 
any management input I had literally no choice but to go to the CEO because at 
least he was awake during the same hours as I was. You can't get things done 
like this. A good project team relies on hundreds of small interactions a day. 
Here in the Fog Creek offices, we have 10 small conversations about FogBUGZ 3.0 
development every day. What I don't understand is people who think it's OK to move the developers ten 
time zones away from their managers and expect good results. Those same people 
would scream bloody murder if you told them that you were going to 
send the whole _management_ team to Bangalore or Beijing.[1] http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20020916.html

The new players include ones built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system.July 17, 2002, 8:30 AM PT
 | Read Full Story Scient files for Chapter 11 Internet consulting firm Scient has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and agreed to sell certain assets to a professional services firm.
The deal calls for Salt Lake City-based SBI to hire some of Scient's employees and to provide up to $4.9 million in financing, pending completion of the asset acquisition.Scient has been struggling for some time now. Once a dot-com darling, the company recently approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split.
The company and SBI said they expect the bankruptcy court to approve the deal, adding that financing ""will allow Scient to continue to deliver services to its clients without interruption until court approval of SBI's acquisition is received.""

 | Read Full Story Yahoo Mail puts words in your mouthWhat does Yahoo Mail have against mocha?
That's what users of the company's free e-mail service may be wondering if they try to send a message using the word ""mocha"" and discover that while in transit, ""mocha"" mysteriously changes to ""espresso.""To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as ""mocha"" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.
The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contain JavaScript instructions that can run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example.

The promotion, which runs through Sept. 30, entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version of the software. Microsoft is also offering two new pieces of downloadable software: one that lets Palm handhelds synchronize directly with Office v. X and another that lets the Macintosh view programs running on a Windows PC or server.July 17, 2002, 3:00 AM PT
 | Read Full Story New chip may portend ATI comebackATI, once the leader in graphics chips, will launch its comeback bid this week with a new chip that experts say could put the company back in front in terms of performance.
The Markham, Ontario-based company on Thursday will unveil the details of the Radeon 9700, a desktop graphics chip based on a new architecture that will provide greater realism when it comes to 3D images, according to sources.The fastest versions of the new chips will offer considerably higher performance than Nvidia's current GeForce4 roster, giving ATI the edge with gamers as well as PC makers, analysts said. And even after Nvidia--which began to chip away at ATI's leading spot in graphics in 1999--comes out with its GeForce 5 in a few months, the competition between the two will remain close.

"toc for linguist list dear sirs , prof . helen dry has offered that we might include announcements of our activities in linguist ( message of 24 april 97 ) . you will find the announcement of a workshop on reported speech below . thank you in advance . manfred roncador announcement of a workshop at the ' 20th conference of the german linguistic society ( dgfs ) ' in halle on ' form and function of reported speech ' coordinators : tom gueldemann and manfred von roncador linguistic studies have increasingly demonstrated that in contrast to the traditional approach a clear-cut distinction between direct and indirect speech is for many languages untenable . the existence of such intermediate forms as semi-direct speech , so-called style indirect libre ( free indirect discourse ) , and logophoric constructions point rather to an analysis whereby the different forms of reported speech are assigned a specific position on a continuum whose extreme poles are characterized by a minimal or maximal shift of the deictic centre ( cf . roncador 1988 ) . in the framework of such a theoretical approach , it is interesting to investigate which different functions the individual forms of reported speech may serve in discourse . another interesting question concerns the grammatical characteristics of quotative constructions ( qc ) , i . e . linguistic expressions used in languages to signal reported speech , and how these qcs are related to the functions of the different categories of reported speech laid out on the continuum mentioned just above . possible features to be investigated in this respect are inter alia the internal structure of qcs , the obligatoriness of the individual propositional elements in them ( such as reference to speaker and addressee ) , the particular strategy for expressing the locutionary aspect , and the nature of the semanto-syntactic relation between qc and the quote itself . the historical processes that qcs or their elements are subject to constitute another possible focus of attention . this is meant to include the discussion on grammaticalization processes in this domain , which is already quite extensive but which has probably focused too much on the development of speech verbs only . as analyses of reported speech in single languages are often still oriented towards concepts developed for european languages , contributions on non - european languages offering new insights on less-known aspects of this functional domain will be particularly welcome . this will serve to put these first attempts to typologize the phenomenon of reported speech in its functional and formal aspects ( cf . roeck 1994 ) on a broader empirical basis . references : roeck , m . de . 1994 . typology of speech reports . in : engberg - pedersen et al .

"Folks,
 
my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux. 
Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.
 
I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?
 
Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.
 
If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.
 
Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat? Opinions
welcome.
 
Thanks a lot,
Peter--

However, if the query string containsvarname[]=FIRST&varname[]=SECONDthen PHP will create an array with varname[1]==FIRST and varname[2]==SECONDThere are other ways to get the data from the HTTP request, and I guess 
I'll do that if it turns out to simplify the script that creates the

"buy - back strategy group , this is an email i sent to our generators regarding decing and buy - back strategies . please read so you know what ' s going , and can take the lead on implementing these strategies . we ' ll let you know when all the generators on board . thanks , stan due to the relatively weak real - time market during morning hours , we wanted to communicate a strategy for dec . bidding or buying - back generation that you ' ve sold forward . we want to stress that this is a relatively short - term strategy . as the weather turns cold during the late - autumn and winter months , the morning hours actually trade at a premium on the real - time market . lately , hel - 10 have been very weak real - time , ranging between $ 25 and $ 40 . we have two strategies that we would like to suggest : 1 . decremental supplemental bids we can submit dec . bids to the iso at a price below your cost to generate . basically , we would be letting the iso know that we ' re willing to reduce generation and actually buy the mw ' s from the iso to cover the prescheduled quantity . you are still paid the day - ahead price for the day - ahead quantity , but instead of generating it , you would be buying it from the iso . for example , if your cost to generate is $ 40 , and you sell day - ahead for $ 50 , you make $ 10 / mwh . if the iso takes the decremental bid , and the price is $ 30 , then you make $ 20 / mwh . advantages - a relatively large upside , the price the iso charges could actually go negative , as large as negative $ 91 . 87 . also , you would actually be buying from the iso , as opposed to selling to the iso and being subject to credit risk . disadvantages - ten minute dispatch . when we submit decremental bids , the iso has the option to either reduce or increase output of the unit every 10 minutes . in addition to the physical problems this might create , the settlements statement you receive might be relatively elaborate and possibly difficult to follow . 2 . buying - back blocks in the bi - lateral market : this strategy calls for our real - time traders to buy blocks of energy in the bi - lateral market for below your cost to generate . this would call for you to reduce your generation , and the energy we buy - back in the real - time market would be used to fill your prescheduled quantity . once again , you are still paid the day - ahead price for the day - ahead quantity , but instead of generating it , you would be buying it at the price paid to buy - back the energy . as in the previous example , if your cost to generate is $ 40 , and you sell day - ahead for $ 50 , you make $ 10 / mwh . if we can buy - back the energy for a price of $ 30 , then you make $ 20 / mwh . additionally , if we do buy - back the energy , we will need to simultaneously submit incremental supplemental bids to the iso to remain compliant with the ferc order . then , if the iso takes the incremental bid , you can generate the power and sell for additional profit . advantages - no 10 minute dispatch ( unless a supplemental bid is accepted ) . you would know exactly when and for how long the unit would be down or reduced . also , the settlements statements would be relatively easy to manage . disadvantage - not as large of an up - side as decremental bidding . at this point in time we would encourage you to start with the strategy # 2 , buying - back blocks of energy in the bi - lateral market . once you and our real - time traders get comfortable with the operations of the strategy , then we should move forward and start submitting decremental supplemental bids to the iso . we propose a 50 / 50 profit split , above your day - ahead profit , earned from either of these two strategies . if you have any questions or comments please call myself or chris foster . stan cocke the services desk 503 - 464 - 3829",0,Safe,zefang_phishing_email_dataset,0,email,True

"qs : serrano and hualapai i ' m cross-posting this to linguist and endangered-languages - l , so apologies if anyone gets two of these . * * * * * question 1 : serrano language ( in san bernardino , california , united states ) i have been searching without luck for anything regarding the serrano people and especially the serrano language . i ' ve been able to find out that there remains * one * speaker of serrano left , but have had no luck so far in contacting her . you know how that goes : a knows b , who knows c , whose aunt ( d ) is the last speaker . ( these are reliable people , so i feel confident that d speaks serrano ; d 's sister , who also spoke serrano , died recently . ) i live about a mile from the san manuel indian reservation . the people there are serrano , but most just know they are "" indian , "" they do n't know what "" tribe . "" at the tribal offices , the woman i spoke to was unaware that there had ever been a serrano language . the information i have so far comes from anthropology / archaeology people and linguists working at the morongo indian reservation ( cahuilla , in banning , california , united states ) . i ' m afraid that serrano will be history within the next couple of years . does anyone know where i might find information on the serrano language or the people who once spoke it ? * * * * * question 2 : hypothetical situation d , above , is the last remaining speaker of serrano . her serrano would be an idiolect , her personal serrano language . suppose i was able to capture all of her knowledge of the language before she dies and write a descriptive grammar which was then used by others to learn serrano , and the language survived . ( would n't it be nice if things worked that way ! ) would the original idiolect then be classified as a language ? dialect ? still an idiolect ? if serrano would still be an idiolect , since my understanding of the language would most likely be slightly different than d 's , would this be * my * ideolect , or * her * idiolect ? * * * * * question 3 : hualapai language ( in peach springs , arizona , united states ) soon , i will be moving to peach springs , arizona , to the hualapai indian reservation . i will be living there for about three months . the hualapai language is still widely used in peach springs ( still a small group of people though ) , and i am going to be doing a very intensive , crash course in hualapai ( two hours per day , every day , with two native speakers , as well as basic communication with other people outside my "" learning "" time ) . by the end of my stay , i hope to be able to communicate with others , but i ' m pretty sure i won't completely master the language in that short amount of time . my "" official job "" is setting up and fixing the computer network for the school there , but i will also be developing some computer applications in hualapai ( as opposed to an english language interface like we are used to seeing ) . i will also be working with the two native speakers to produce a few books written in hualapai . in addition to these books , i am going to try to translate some public-domain children 's classics , for example _ the wonderful wizard of oz _ , to help me with learning the language , as well as providing great stories for the kids there . i also plan on writing a journal of my learning of the hualapai language ( adult l2 acquisition study ) . i am a self-taught , amateur linguist - - i . e . , i read a lot and pester people with questions . the only formal education i have is a 10 - week course in ( english ) language acquisition by children . my question is , is there any interest outside the hualapai reservation for the software , books , or journal ? the books will be printed and we will need to know how many copies to print ( i . e . , just for use at the school , or extras for other people , too ) . a new edition of the hualapai grammar has been finished ( the old edition is 8 - 1 / 2 x 11 , 575 pages ; i have n't seen the new one yet ) , but not gone to the printers yet , and a dictionary is in the making . the software and journal can be duplicated as needed , but the books can be printed with title vii funds ( government money ) if they are for use at the school only , but we will have to make other funding arrangements if the books are to be sold to people outside the school . is anyone interested ? * * * * * fyi i developed a font for typing in hualapai . it is * not * intended to be a general-purpose , one-size - fits-all font , it is intended to allow rapid typing in hualapai . the font is a times typeface . currently , i have truetype and postsrcipt versions for ibm-pc compatible computers , and in the near future , macintosh versions of truetype and postscript fonts will be available . the sil ( summer institute of linguistics ) and a couple of sites in germany have offered me space on their ftp computers for the font . any other ftp sites would be appreciated . when i get the fonts uploaded , i ' ll post addresses to the lists . the font is "" postcard-ware , "" i . e . , it is free , but you have to send us a postcard from your hometown . : - ) * * * * * as is usual , i will post summaries of answers to my questions to the list if there is sufficient interest . thanks for wading through this long-winded message . chuck coker cjcoker @ csupomona . edu ccoker @ igc . apc . org",0,Safe,zefang_phishing_email_dataset,0,email,True

"Short version:
T-Mobile Broadband is in the process of wiring every starbucks in the area
(T1 backhauled to some ~local POP + 802.11) as part of what I'm told is a
national rollout. The Diesel is close enough to the Elm St starbucks for me
to get reasonable net throughout most of the cafe. The rumor is that they'll be announcing that they've got boston covered on
the 21st.  I've heard from at least one source that they're actually going
to announce a much wider national rollout at that time.  It's not cheap [1], but
for soemone like me who's running a ~virtual corporation, it's well worth it.[1] https://accounts.tmobilebroadband.com/net_offers_promos.htmOn Thu, Aug 15, 2002 at 04:51:07PM -0400, Luis Villa wrote:

"change of control provisions as many of you know , i have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $ 20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of enron . the merger with dynegy , or a similar transaction with any other company , would trigger this provision on closing . assuming the merger with dynegy is closed within 6 - 9 months , as we expect , this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $ 60 million . many ceos have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989 . but given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees , i have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment . initially , i thought i would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash . however , after talking to a number of employees this afternoon , i have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment . therefore , at closing , i will receive no payments under this provision . i know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face . but please know that i will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of enron ' s employees and shareholders . i am still very proud of what we have built at enron , and i want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore enron to its rightful place in the energy industry . thank you .",0,Safe,zefang_phishing_email_dataset,0,email,True

People in council houses are 'worthless and lazy'. Ramblers are 'nosy perverts'. Nicholas van Hoogstraten, a man who once paid for a hand-grenade attack on a business rival, shows Emma Brockes around his Sussex palace and explains why he's so keen to keep the riff-raff awayFriday September 8, 2000 ... On the way down from the roof, through the ""workers' quarters"" which Van Hoogstraten intends to fill with staff from Zimbabwe, he returns to the subject of peasants, expanding on the ""worthless"" and ""lazy"" majority who make up the council estates of this country. ""You are playing up to your villainous image,"" I suggest. Van Hoogstraten looks momentarily embarrassed. ""I'm not villainous,"" he mumbles. I ask if he regards the people who work for him in these derogatory terms, and he says no, because they work hard and hard labour is what distinguishes the ""riff-raff"" from the ""elite"". I ask him if being a person of quality is merely a matter of wealth. He says no, and refers to some of his wealthy neighbours, ""old-moneyed bastards"" whom he regards as being as primitive in their idleness as ""those rat bags drawing social security.""... He was in the Bahamas when President John F Kennedy was shot, and amidst the public mourning, remembers being pleased. ""I was glad,"" he says. ""He was only in it for the ego trip."" He claims similar feelings on hearing news of Diana's death, while returning from France on a ferry. ""She made us look like fools,"" he says. ""She made a mockery of the royal family."" Van Hoogstraten's relationship with authority is riddled with contradictions. He says he hated Diana because she was thick, but when you point out that the rest of the royal family are pretty thick too, he says gloopily, ""they are all we've got, so we have to respect them."" He says he favours dictatorship as the best form of government, but complains that some of the officials he has dealt with in Mugabe's Zimbabwe are impossible because ""the power has gone to their heads."" (Mugabe himself is the most modest man he has ever met, he says, and he is friends with Ian Smith, who apart from the small matter of his hysterical racism, he finds charming). Margaret Thatcher is the only leader he has ever admired, because she made him feel ""proud to be English"". ...The 'van' is of course a late affectation - always an indication of a genuine dickhead.

"california update 4 / 05 / 01 below is the transcript of an interview conducted yesterday with state treasurer phil angelides : summary : ? bond issuance to be $ 10 b with 10 - 15 year term , 70 % tax exempt and 30 % non - exempt ? angelides in favor of wind fall profit tax ? opposed to current discussion between davis and socal in regards to socal paying off the generators over 12 years with a 2 - year grace period what decisions on rate components are necessary before you can sell bonds ? "" the big things we need are that the puc must enter into agreement with dwr , essentially warranting that sufficient revenues from rates will be available for purchasing power . it is really their job to define what each party needs to pay for power . we need to give assurance to the investment community that whatever the overall rate is , the state will get enough to pay its bonds . however , if the utilities challenge the decision , it could stall the bond issuance . "" what do you think will be the size of the first bond issue ? "" based on what is currently possible and what the legislature has authorized , around $ 10 bn . the puc has allowed us to sell north of $ 13 bn , but we anticipate that $ 10 bn is absorbable . until the administration provides details for this office and the public on what its costs of buying power are and what it needs in terms of funding , what will drive it is that number , not what the puc has said . the issuance may well be a single $ 10 bn issue or a series of smaller ones done together , e . g . $ 3 bn each 3 weeks apart . "" what is the total size of the market for ca tax - exempt bonds ? "" what we do normally is $ 5 - 10 bn in bonds for various revenues or general obligations . in 1997 the ca infrastructure rate reductions bonds was a $ 7 bn issuance , and this was handled well . this is not exclusively a ca market . around $ 200 bn of these bonds is sold each year . we anticipate that the bonds will be 70 % tax - exempt and 30 % non - exempt . "" what is the total of electric supply contracts that are firm enough to require funding ? "" we have estimates . the dwr is buying power , and let ' s say power costs $ 100 and its portion of rates is $ 70 . this bond issuance covers the diff between $ 100 and $ 70 . so , the bond issuance is a way to cover the gap . however , if power prices do not come down , you cannot keep borrowing . if we issue more than $ 10 bn in bonds , i have to see the whole financial plan . ( the implication is that he will not keep this plan secret . ) "" what will be the term mix of the bond issues ? "" overall term is expected to be in the 10 - 15 year range . i do not know the mix . "" do you have the ability to do bridging tax anticipation notes or anything like that to take care of the general fund ? "" the very purpose of the bridge loan is that we are taking a taxable and tax - exempt bridge loan until bonds are issued . in order for us to issue bonds , a number of steps have to occur . i would hope that the puc and dwr do what they have to do realistically by june . then the bond issuance would come semi all - at - once . ( in other words , either all at once , or something like $ 3 billion every three weeks . ) "" are all of the general funds ' assets in cash , or are some in the form of a less liquid receivable ? "" we have a lot of liquidity in real cash in general fund . we have a cash flow . we have the ability in pooled money investment accounts so that we can go out to five years . we have $ 40 bn - plus in that account . "" what is the minimum working capital required in the general fund for day - to - day operations ? "" it depends , and goes up and down . on any given day we are doing on the order of $ 500 mm . there is a $ 100 bn budget between the general funds and special fund . "" are you discussing the dwr contracting in relation to the required funding ? do you have a veto on the deals struck ? "" this is all in the administration ' s court . what we have asked for is the information . we have asked for this today by letter . we have to move from working with 3 or 4 banks to a public offering , which means public disclosure . the general fund has been making advances to buy power , but we want to get out of that business and to stop the $ 4 bn plus drain on general fund from arranging an interim loan . "" what is the credit risk from industry or other large users cherry picking or self - selecting ?

July 10, 2002 Greetings from Download.com!
If you're developing Windows applications in an
ActiveX-compatible environment (which includes most major ones
such as Visual Basic and C++), it's time you started taking
advantage of prefab programming components. An amazing array of
controls are out there, with more arriving at Download.com
every day. This week, we've collected the top programs that
handle transparent GIF files, offer prebuilt ActiveX controls,
and edit hex code to get you up and running.Also this week, we've got two really useful ActiveX entries:
FileSystem 1.2 and AppSecureX 2.9. FileSystem gives you access
to drives, folders, and I/O operations; and AppSecureX adds
serial number and shareware-type functionality to your
applications.Becky Waring
Contributing Editor, CNET Download.com
From Builder.comSix
MySQL/PHP functions to streamline development
Code reuse is one of the keys to increasing developer
     productivity. This article looks at several handy functions
     you can use to save time when building applications using
     PHP and MySQL.Faking
SOAP principles with familiar techniques
SOAP is everywhere you turn. But what exactly is it? Take
     this guided tour to gain working knowledge of this emerging
     standard.in ActiveX
FileSystem 1.2
Having problems wrangling the Windows File System? The
   FileSystem ActiveX control offers complete access to common
   file information under Windows through three independent
   interfaces. Everything from drive and folder access to file
   I/O operations is available with only a few lines of code.
   Use this control's interfaces to detect media types and
   media insertion, get complete lists of folders and files at
   unlimited folder depth, find out what attributes are set on
   files, and even load logbook files into collections
   automatically. Rope in your files.
ApSecureX 2.9
Prevent pirates from copying your software with AppSecureX.
   This control provides a registration system that produces a
   valid serial number customized to the user's machine. When
   the user installs your software, a unique ID number is
   generated for that system. To get the serial number, the
   user must provide you with his installation number. The
   data file created by the application is encrypted
   differently for each system, so even if someone were to
   crack the file, they couldn't use the information on
   another machine. AppSecure can also give your software
   shareware functionality such as number of days left, checking
   to see if the system clock is set back, and so on. AppSecureX
   works with any ActiveX-enabled programming language such as
   Microsoft Visual Basic or Microsoft Visual C++. A demo
   application is included. Lock up your software.
in Java
AppletFile 2.5
AppletFile is a set of Java applets that will enhance your
   Web site's file upload and download capabilities. In
   addition to support for SSL, proxy, and authenticated
   uploading, users can upload and download multiple files
   using predefined paths to automate the process as much as
   possible. A scripting language provides for sophisticated
   customization, and the user interface includes support for
   12 different languages. Transfers are faster because the
   applet uses its own compression (AutoZIP). The AutoSYNC
   feature downloads only updated files, and verification of
   file transfer integrity is made possible with built-in
   support for MD5 message digests. AppletFile is based on
   HTTP protocols and is firewall-friendly. This update adds
   Sun's Java Plug-in support for Netscape 6+ browsers and
   shows removable media drives in the browse dialog. Beam up
   your files.
in Tools & Editors
PHP Master Editor 2.0
Write, edit, and debug PHP scripts and HTML pages with this
   tool. PHP Master Editor includes an internal browser for
   viewing, as well as a debugger for local testing. Basic FTP
   capability is also included. Specifically designed for PHP
   programmers, the program recognizes and formats functions,
   variables, and classes within the code, and features
   customizable code templates. Get code-happy.Â

"ua appeal : arief budiman urgent action appeal : re : the unhonorable discharge of dr . arief budiman from university of satya wacana , salatiga , indonesia dr . arief budiman , one of the most consistent defenders of freedom of speech in indonesia and an outspoken critic of indonesian government , was fired from his position as a senior lecturer in the post graduate department at the christian university of satya wacana ( uksw ) , salatiga , indonesia . the letter of dismissal that will take effect on october 31st , 1994 , was issued on october 17th , and was cosigned by prof . haryono semangun ( chairman ) and drs . nelky oemboe nganggoe ( secretary ) of the university 's board of trustees . the letter said that dr . budiman has been unhonorably discharged because of not following the critique ethics adopted by the university . he was also accused of circulating issues discrediting the university 's board of trustees and rector . what dr . budiman actually did was only publicly expressing critical opinion againts the board 's controversial decision on the appoinment of the new rector , dr . john ihalauw . previously , dr . budiman received two letters of reprimand from the board , but no specific "" misconduct "" was mentioned in both letters . two additional notes must be mentioned . first , over the year the board has been under constant pressures from the majority of the faculty members , students , and administrative staffs of the university to revoke the appointment of the new rector , which was considered illegitimate . the same academic community has expressed public support for dr . budiman 's initiative to file a lawsuit againts the board . secondly , all of this is taking place as an increasingly sweeping clamp - down of intellectual activism has been heightening in the past two weeks , presumably in preparation for the upcoming apec summit in jakarta this november . there is a possibility that this dismissal was also intended at punishing dr . budiman and closing his opportunities to continue expressing his criticism to the indonesian authorities . in a separate case , dr . george junus aditjondro , another uksw 's lecturer and a close friend of dr . budiman , is still under police 's interrogation for insulting the state authorities while speaking in a seminar in another campus . this arbitrary measure againts dr . budiman has demonstrated how such an academic institution as uksw has violated the principles of freedom of speech and has threatened the democratic atmosphere within the academic community . his dismissal will be detrimental not only to the world-wide known reputation of uksw as one of more committed universities , but also to the dynamic of indonesia intelectual and academic life as well . as members of academic communities and individuals who are concerned with the maintenance of freedom of speech , we should express our concern to this arbitrary action . please send letter , fax , or make a call to the board of trustess of uksw for : - expressing concern at the unhonorable discharge of dr . arief budiman - asking the board to reconsider the decision and to give dr . arif budiman an opportunity to defend himself in front of the university 's senate and academic community in general . mailing address : prof . dr . ir . haryono semangun ketua umum dewan pengurus yayasan perguruan tinggi kristen satya wacana ( board of trustees satya wacana christian university ) jl . diponegoro 52-60 salatiga 50711 indonesia phones : ( 62 ) ( 298 ) - , 81362 , 81363 , 81364 fax : ( 62 ) ( 298 ) 81420 telex : 22364 ukswsa ia for more information , e-mail : amrih widodo at awidodo @ facstaff . uwisc . edu heri akhmadi at jpnn @ clark . net",0,Safe,zefang_phishing_email_dataset,0,email,True

"syllable structure and gesture timing call for papers : syllable stucture and gesture timing as part of the conference lp ' 98 to be held at ohio state university sept . 15-20 , there will be a workshop funded by the national science foundation sept . 19-20 , on ' syllable structure and gesture timing ' , covering issues related to phonetic and phonological accounts of segmentation , and timing and ordering of gestures in speech , especially how sequences of consonants e . g . [ spr ] , [ ntw ] are formally represented . speech is traditionally represented as a string of segments , defined in terms of features which are implemented simultaneously . in that conception , the phoneme is the minimal phonological unit where time and ordering are defined . as has long been known , the transition from phoneme to phoneme is phonetically realized as a continuous change . there has been a steady progression in phonological theory from linear generative theory to nonlinear representations where the mapping between segments and features is quite relaxed , and highly articulated suprasegmental structures are assumed . a consequence of nonlinear models , which allow single 's egments ' to bear multiple values of a feature and allow one feature to be associated with many 's egments ' , is that one can meaningfully question the existence of the 's egment ' as a formal object . the theory of feature geometry does not explicitly represent the notion 's egment ' , and it has been argued that the traditional segment does not correspond to any specific level of representation in current models . nonlinear models have increasingly tended towards positing complex but internally timeless single 's egments ' in place of clusters of segments : thus , what was formerly represented as a triconsonantal sequence [ ntw ] might also be represented as a single segment , a ' voiceless prenasalised rounded alveolar ' . some languages , such as bella coola and georgian , seem to allow unbounded arbitrary sequences of consonants , which suggests that phonological theory may ultimately need to allow infinitely long syllables and unstructured onsets and codas . one of the central questions to be taken up in the workshop is "" are there any universal limits on possible strings of segments in various positions within the syllable "" ? this statement of the question begs two quite important questions : do segments per se exist ( and how can one identify whether a given temporal stretch of the phonetic output corresponds to one or more segments ) , and do syllables themselves exist ? both of these assumptions remain controversial , especially in nonlinear phonology . invited speakers for this workshop include donca steriade , john ohala , john harris and louis goldstein . further details on the issues being investigated in this workshop can be found at http : / / ling . ohio-state . edu / events / phon _ workshop . html . one - page abstracts for 30 minute papers to be presented at this workshop are solicited ( due date for receipt of abstracts : august 10 ) . lodging and up to $ 400 to cover economy travel expenses will be provided to authors presenting papers at the workshop . abstracts may be sent by email to odden @ ling . ohio-state . edu , or by surface mail to : syllable workshop department of linguistics ohio state university columbus , oh 43210 please include a surface mail address , email address , and phone number .",0,Safe,zefang_phishing_email_dataset,0,email,True

"[followups to spambayes@python.org please, unless you're specifically
 concerned about some particular bit of email policy for python.org]OK, after much fiddling with and tweaking of /etc/exim/exim4.conf and
/etc/exim/local_scan.py on mail.python.org, I am fairly confident that
I can start harvesting all incoming email at a moment's notice.  For the
record, here's how it all works:  * exim4.conf works almost exactly the same as before if the file
    /etc/exim/harvest does not exist.  That is, any ""junk mail
    condition"" that can be detected by Exim ACLs (access control lists)
    is handled entirely in exim4.conf: the message is rejected before it
    ever gets to local_scan.py.  This covers such diverse cases as
    ""message from known spammer"" (reject after every RCPT TO command),
    ""no message-id header"", and ""8-bit chars in subject"" (both rejected
    after the message headers/body are read).    The main things I have changed in the absence of /etc/exim/harvest
    are:
      - don't check for 8-bit chars in ""From"" header -- the vast
        majority of hits for this test were bounces from some
        Asian ISP; the remaining hits should be handled by SpamAssassin
      - do header sender verification (ie. ensure that there's a
        verifiable email address in at least one of ""From"", ""Reply-to"",
        and ""Sender"") as late as possible, because it requires DNS
        lookups which can be slow (and can also make messages that
        should have been rejected merely be deferred, if those DNS
        lookups timeout)  * if /etc/exim/harvest exists, then the behaviour of all of those
    ACLs in exim4.conf suddenly changes: instead of rejecting recipients
    or messages, they add an X-reject header to the message.  This
    header is purely for internal use; it records the name of the folder
    to which the rejected message should be saved, and also gives the
    SMTP error message which should ultimately be used to reject
    the message.    Thus, those messages will now be seen by local_scan.py, which now
    looks for the X-reject header.  If found, it uses the folder name
    specified there to save the message, and then rejects it with the
    SMTP error message also given in X-reject.  (Currently X-reject is
    retained in saved messages.)    If a message was not tagged with X-reject, then local_scan.py
    runs the usual virus and spam checks.  (Namely, my homebrew
    scan for attachments with filenames that look like Windows
    executables, and a run through SpamAssassin.)  The logic is
    basically this:
      if virus:
          folder = ""virus""
      else:
          run through SpamAssassin
          if score >= 10.0:
              folder = ""rejected-spam""
          elif score >= 5.0:
              folder = ""caught-spam""    Finally, local_scan.py writes the message to the designated folder.
    By far the biggest folder will be ""accepted"" -- the server handles
    2000-5000 incoming messages per day, of which maybe 100-500 are junk
    mail.  (Oops, just realized I haven't written the code that actually
    saves the message -- d'ohh!  Also haven't written anything to
    discriminate personal email, which I must do.  Sigh.)  * finally, the big catch: waiting until after you've read the message
    headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic,
    because certain broken MTAs (including those used by some spammers)
    don't consider a 5xx after DATA as a permanent error, but keep
    retrying.  D'ohh.  This is a minor annoyance currently, where a fair
    amount of stuff is rejected at RCPT TO time.  But in harvest mode,
    *everything* (with the exception of people probing for open relays)
    will be rejected at DATA time.  So I have cooked up something called
    the ASBL, or automated sender blacklist.  This is just a Berkeley DB
    file that maps (sender_ip, sender_address) to an expiry time.  When
    local_scan() rejects a message from (sender_ip, sender_address) --
    for whatever reason, including finding an X-reject header added by
    an ACL in exim4.conf -- it adds a record to the ASBL, with an expiry
    time 3 hours in the future.  Meanwhile, there's an ACL in exim4.conf
    that checks for records in the ASBL; if there's a record for the
    current (sender_ip, sender_address) that hasn't expired yet, we
    reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or
    body.    The downside of this from the point-of-view of corpus collection is
    that if some jerk is busily spamming *@python.org, one SMTP
    connection per address, we will most likely only get one copy.  This
    is a win if you're just thinking about reducing server load and
    bandwidth, but I'm not sure if it's helpful for training spam
    detectors.  Tim?Happy harvesting --        Greg

"Hi,I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.Well, grasshopper, think again ...It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  It's that simple ...All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.Here goes ...Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot

nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.

"davis appoints cpuc commissioner gov . davis announced today his appointment of mike peevey as commissioner at the cpuc to replace com . bilas who resigned last week . mr . peevey is the former president of southern california edison and as such advocated deregulation . consumer group advocates are concerned about his past record and oppose his nomination which is subject to state senate approval . below is an article from the sacramento bee . gh davis names ex - edison chief to puc but the action stirs anger : ' our worst nightmare , ' says a consumer lawyer . by stuart leavenworth - - bee staff writer published 5 : 30 a . m . pst wednesday , march 6 , 2002 gov . gray davis has appointed a former president of southern california edison to a state panel charged with regulating edison and other public utilities . davis said michael r . peevey would bring "" more than three decades of experience "" to the public utilities commission - - experience that immediately came under fire from the state ' s consumer groups . mike florio , a lawyer for the utility reform network , said peevey has a record , both in government and in business , of pushing for higher rates for small businesses and residential consumers . "" this is a our worst nightmare , "" florio said . "" it is like putting dr . kevorkian in charge of a nursing home . "" others were more supportive . d . j . smith , a lobbyist who represents large industrial energy users , lauded peevey as someone "" who understands all sides of the energy business "" and will be fair to all sides .

"Thank you for your interest!Judgment Coursesoffers an extensive training
course in ""How to Collect MoneyJudgments""If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income .If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.""The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoney
Judgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5more
Judgments take its place.We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.The income potential is substantial in this profession. We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time .One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)Quote's from several of our students:Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .Your
professionalism in both the manual and your support.  
You have the video opened doors for me in the future. 
There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states 
he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on""After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us: ""I am now making $2,000.00 per
week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now""After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
""I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help out""Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months"">From the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:With our course you can own your own successful business.
A business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. A business which is
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
day is new and exciting.None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen
for many others already. Make it happen for you!If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.Please call us at 1-281-500-4018.We have Service Support staff available to you from 8:00am to
10:00pm (Central Time) 7 days a week . If you callthis number
you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.
They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person
can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not.Thank you for your time and interest.+++++

High-Altitude Rambos
By BOB HERBERTDr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake
Worth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in
one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the
U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from
Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section
began behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do
with Dr. Rajcoomar.Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back
to coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight
man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer
refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying
out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza.They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him
in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite
jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight
attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident,
already scary, could - and should - have ended there. But the marshals were
not ready to let things quiet down.One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The
marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and
remain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any
reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try
to visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who
disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were
terrorists on the plane.""I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized
cabin,"" said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of
Common Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an
aisle seat in coach. ""I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire
in a shootout.""Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her
husband, said, ""It was really like Rambo in the air."" She worried that
there might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore
did not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to the
bathroom, he or she might be shot.There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When
the plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into
custody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals
grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that
anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where
he was thrown into a filthy cell.This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr.
Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into
custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening
hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were
eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B.
McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration,
which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the
incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr.
Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident ""too
closely.""If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters
are headed for jail.Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. ""I
had never been treated like that in my life,"" he said. ""I was afraid that I
was about to be beaten up or killed.""Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and
he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful
detention.""We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security,"" said
Dr. Rajcoomar. ""So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in
this great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of
security.""--

"http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633932.Bizarre+London.0.htmlAn investigation has been launched after punch bags on sale in Greenwich 
were found to be stuffed with incontinence pads and bandages.Trading standards officers, working for Greenwich Council, were alerted to 
the situation after a Bryan punch bag, purchased in Argos, in Charlton Road, 
Charlton, was found to be full of bandages.Also stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a 
woman in Fife stating how she felt quite disgusted' about the bag and asking 
for the filling to be tested.The unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag, at Argos, in Lewisham High 
Street, but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was 
horrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads.So far, officers have purchased two of the punch bags, only to find they 
contain incontinence pads and strips of shredded duvet.Cabinet member for public services Councillor Angela Cornforth said: ""This 
is one of the strangest stories I have every heard.""Our officers are in the process of investigating and will no doubt discover 
why the bags contain such unusual contents.""12:18 Tuesday 8th October 2002

"re : 5 . 1225 linguistics and imperialism with regard to hoberman 's comment , it would not make sense to say that linguistics is inherently imperialistic in nature , any more than it would for any other science , since linguistics is multi-faceted and has many purposes , some now well established and others continually evolving , e . g . , "" forensic "" applications of linguistics etc . since language is universal , applications for linguistics are universal . in my earlier comments i dwelt on diversity among languages because that 's where the connection between linguistics ( mainly as an aid to learning and teaching languages ) and multilingual empires ( = "" imperialism "" ) is easiest to see . however , i also noted that there are people who are interested in language and linguistic diversity for its own sake . i suspect that this is universal . although it may be reflected differently in different cultures . maybe the universality of interest in language and linguistic diversity is reflected in myths about the origin of such diversity , or other kinds of "" pre-linguistic "" explanations . among cultures which seem particularly ethnocentric to me , classic athenian culture perhaps was less encouraging to interest in other languages than most cultures ( with the us perhaps close behind but also with a complex fear and insecurity about languages other than english ) . nevertheless , we see from plato 's cratylus that differences between greek ( in its various diachronic forms ) and the "" barbarian "" languages was put to philosophical use . if you read cratylus , you ' ll see that plato , through socrates , was putting some value on philosophical arguments which brought in data from other languages . ( even though there 's a lot of sarcasm and tongue in cheek in the whole issue as plato treats it in cratylus , i . e . , whether the words of language are "" natural "" or "" conventional "" / are there "" correct "" words for ideas / concepts / things ? - - plato is always a polemicist , reacting to rival schools of thought . ) i would like to re-open the issue ( i think it was once opened before on the list ) about how different cultures "" explain "" language diversity , and whether there is a culture which prevents all individual members from being interested in language for its own sake . i do n't think that could logically be possible - - but what do i know ? in any case , this might give us some insights into the "" prehistory of linguistics "" , and also into the still present motivations of some linguists to attach themselves to this aspect of our culture . benji",0,Safe,zefang_phishing_email_dataset,0,email,True

( canadian nat gas , canadian power , us nat gas , us power , us coal , us emissions , us weather , us crude , us bandwidth ) natsource llc ( us nat gas , us power , canadian nat gas , us coal , us emissions ) amerex natural gas i , ltd .

"Hi all...I'm new to SpamAssasin so I appologies if the question has been asked
before.
I'm thinking of setting up SA with my Qmail(Maildir) server acting as our
gateway.
It currently provides inline virus scanning and ORDB open relay filtering.
Is it possible to setup SA to act as a sitewide Spam filter ?
Is there any documentation on setting this up ?
The Qmail server does not house any local mail accounts, it acts as a pure
relay for our internal mail server, I am currently relaing mail for 8
internal domains...Suggestions would be appreciated.Regards

"THE ULTIMATE WAY TO WORK FROM HOME 
THE BEST MONEY MAKING SYSTEM OF ALL!! 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV 
As seen on 20/20 and many other credible references. This is NOT a scam. 
I hope this is ok that I send you this. If you aren't interested, just 
simply delete it. 
READ THIS MESSAGE if you are like me and want more than your lousy 
weekly paycheck. Make more in a few months than last year at work. 
Believe it, work it. 
This really works, don't make the same mistake I made. I deleted this 
4-5 times before finally giving it a try. Within 2 weeks the orders 
(money) 
started coming in just like the plan below said it would. Give it a 
try!! 
You will be glad you did. 
Thanks and Good Luck! You won't need luck, just keep reading. Don't 
delete this!!! 
------------------------------------------------------ 
First read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. See below.... 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report. 
PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN 
IN HIS CLOSET! 
Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. 
You most likely have just seen this story recently 
featured on a major nightly news program (USA). 
And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck 
of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning 
and putting laundry away when she came across a large 
brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath 
some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 
15-year-old sons closet. 
Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got 
when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. 
Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - 
all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. 
""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", 
says the 41-year-old woman, ""There was over $71,000 
dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband 
earns in a year"". 
The woman immediately called her husband at the 
car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she 
had discovered. He came home right away and they 
drove together to the boys school and picked him up. 
Little did they suspect that where the money came from 
was more shocking than actually finding it in 
the closet. 
As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via 
E-mail, a type of ""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he 
obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for 
the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his 
computer in his bedroom. 
""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the 
heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said 
and I started sending it out"", says the clever 
15-year-old. 
The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained 
instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person 
on the list, then delete the address at the top and 
move the others addresses down, and finally to add 
your name to the top of the list. 
The letter goes on to state that you would receive 
several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 
weeks if you sent out the letter with your 
name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk 
E-mail all the time, and really did not think it was 
going to work"", the boy continues. 
Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, 
the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him 
for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to 
fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing 
$5 bills. 
""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post 
office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 
envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip 
that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. 
I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He 
goes on, ""I went up to the counter and they had a 
whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back 
home and empty out my backpack because I could not 
carry it all"". 
Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending 
out the E-mail. ""The money just kept coming in and I 
just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, 
barely had time for my homework"". He had also 
been riding his bike to several of the banks in his 
area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties 
and hundreds. 
""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept 
riding to different banks with like five thousand at a 
time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at 
the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to 
exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. 
One time the lady gave me a really strange look and 
told me that she would not be able to do it for me and 
my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just 
rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)."" 
Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be 
afraid. The reporting news team examined and 
investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was 
sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter 
at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to 
US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 
1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also 
in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, 
Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service 
must be exchanged for money received. 
Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a 
little note that read, ""Please send me report number 
XYX"".This simple note made the letter legal because he 
was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a 
five-dollar fee.

Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the 
letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the 
popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news 
program 
recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program 
described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show 
also 
investigated whether or not the program was legal. 
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO 
Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow 
the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 
$25 out of pocket cost''. 
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS 
PROGRAM HAS 
ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. 
This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. 
I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so 
glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for 
the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received 
total 
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. 
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.

=======Here is 
another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a 
long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this 
again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the 
simple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to 
come 
in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that 
made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering 
the 
program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change 
anything.'' More testimonials later but first:

INSTRUCTIONS: 
================Order all 5 reports shown on the list below 
================= 
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT 
YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose 
name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN 
ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail 
problems. 
=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 
reports. 
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer 
and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. 
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports 
from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will 
be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk 
in case something happens to your computer. 
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed 
next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other 
than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will 
loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this 
works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, 
this 
method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People 
have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they 
could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all 
have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change 
anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not 
work for you. 
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 
1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement 
and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT #5. 
This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting 
their fortune. 
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. 
PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!

**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it 
on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. 
Save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. To assist 
you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you 
purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which 
includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of 
free 
classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this 
venture going: 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
=========================================================
======= 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and 
we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. 
Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the 
response 
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many 
people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 
each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. 
With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 
Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total 
of 50,000. 
Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 
people responded and ordered Report # 2. 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 
e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. 
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 
million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders 
for Report! # 4. Whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a 
total of 
50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 
orders for 
Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half 
million). 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 
+ 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand 
Total=$555,550.00 
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE 
WORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU 
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL 
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! 
=========================================================
======= 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING 
OUT 
OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if 
everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails 
each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide 
and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! 
METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
=========================================================
======= 
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are 
hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the 
Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you 
start with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you 
receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's 
it. Always provide 
same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your 
name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise 
until they receive the report. 
===================AVAILABLE REPORTS 
========================== 
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always 
send 
$5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure 
the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On 
one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you 
are ordering, 
YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

TESTIMONIALS====================== 
'' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an 
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good 
money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 
''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of 
the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody 
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in 
with 
both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 
''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was 
on me! 
Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she 
had 
received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have 
joined 
Jody in her ''hobby''. 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 
=========================================================
======= '' Not 
being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my 
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided 
that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that 
I 
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was 
surprised 
when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made 
$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is 
that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better 
investment 
with a faster return and so big''. 
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 
=========================================================
======= '' I had 
received this program before. I deleted it, but later I 
wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who 
to contact ! to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed 
again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came 
again.....I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my 
first try and all the money came within 22 weeks''. 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. 
=========================================================
====== 
'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with 
little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and 
within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made 
$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $ 
362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet''.

===============================Thousands spent on strippers, golf memberships
shows Pentagon spending is out of control, Libertarians sayWASHINGTON, DC -- Quiz question: Which of the following items have been 
charged to the taxpayers recently by military personnel wielding 
government-issued credit cards?(a) $38,000 for lap dancing at strip clubs near military bases.(b) $3,400 for a Sumo wrestling suit and $9,800 for Halloween costumes.(c) $7,373 for closing costs on a home and $16,000 for a corporate golf 
membership.(d) $4,600 for white beach sand and $19,000 worth of decorative ""river 
rock"" at a military base in the Arabian desert.(e) all of the above.""Incredibly, the answer is 'all of the above,' said Steve Dasbach, 
Libertarian Party executive director. ""Thanks to the federal 
government's policy of doling out credit cards with no questions asked, 
the military has launched a raid on your wallet.""The shocking revelations are contained in a General Accounting Office 
audit released last week that uncovered $101 million in ""seemingly 
unneeded expenditures"" made by the Air Force and Army in 2000 and 
2001. The purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax 
credit card policy: At least 1.4 million Defense Department employees 
carry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1 
billion in goods and services, the audit found.In one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military IDs and 
government-issued travel cards to get cash at adult-entertainment bars, 
then spent the money there. The clubs charged a 10 percent fee to 
supply the soldiers with cash -- then billed the full amount to their 
travel cards as a restaurant charge, the GAO found.""Are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a 
strip club, or defending our country while wearing a Sumo wrestling 
suit?"" asked Dasbach. ""Americans who support a bigger defense budget, 
take note: The Pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated, 
reckless government agency. It promises your money will be spent on the 
worthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even 
imagine.""Other spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury 
cruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and 
armchair at a military installation in the Middle East, Dasbach noted.
 
Some military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit 
noted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can 
be ""a useful tool for building good relations with a host country"" 
such as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates. Not surprisingly, Dasbach said, the audit found ""little evidence of 
documented disciplinary action"" against those who misused the cards, 
so taxpayers may end up paying the tab.
  
""It's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat 
Defense Department workers, and force them to personally reimburse 
taxpayers for every penny of improper spending,"" he said.
 
""Then cut the Pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard 
against such wasteful spending in the future. Perhaps that's one way to 
force the Pentagon to spend its resources defending the country, 
instead of offending the taxpayer.""

"anyone to fully bury global warming, they would have to bury the Greens. A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn't existed they would have had to invent it. So it is with global warming. Their fundamental opposition isn't to a warmer earth, it is to industrial civilization.The fact that the sattelites didn't match what the global warming theorists said should be there is old news. The news here is that the temperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have been validated with a different means of measurement.Rather than have to defend CO2 concentrations as not causing global warming, people who believe in CO2 need a good explanation of the ""Medieval Warm Period"". Said period was warmer than what we have now, and it obvioiusly wasn't caused by CO2.In point of fact the predicted global warming due to CO2 is not caused DIRECTLY by CO2. CO2 doesn't trap that much heat. Water vapor does, and if you can get more water vapor in the air due to CO2 then you have your warming theory.Yet it would seem that the very stability of the earth's climate over long periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback loops but one where negative feedback loops predominate.More water vapor can increase temperatuers, but that also leads to more clouds. Clouds both trap heat and reflect it, so it depends a great deal on how the cloud formation shakes out. Most climate models admit they do clouds very poorly.A good link is: http://www.techcentralstation.be/2051/wrapper.jsp?PID=2051-100&CID=2051- 060302A > -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Jim > Whitehead > Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 12:23 PM > To: Robert Harley; fork@spamassassin.taint.org > Subject: RE: Goodbye Global Warming > > > Gary Lawrence Murphy wrote: > > >and say hello to the cool: Oooo ... /this/ is going to cause > > some stir ... > > > > Of course not.

"Here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with 
no reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to 
be that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la 
Wilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, 
ev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more 
partners than women.  I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether 
the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely 
promiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get 
even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other 
men. 
http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html<>
As for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme 
promiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the 
Band Played On. He writes about  bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses 
how, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you 
might call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having 
many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an 
explicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.
    That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of 
Schiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played 
in spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many 
others. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that 
there was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.Tom

"fw : ferc meeting summary the commission held its first open meeting with pat wood as the new chairman today and discussed many interesting issues . the following is a summary of the meeting . the meeting is still going on , and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon ( regarding market power ) . rtos chairman wood expressed his desire to finish the rto transition , and that the commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the rto transition . chairman wood considers the rto effort on two tracks : 1 ) organizational - - what will the rto organizations look like , and 2 ) substantive - - once you set up the organizations , what will they do . organizational effort : wood stated that this effort has already begun with the july 12 orders and the northeast and southeast mediation efforts . the commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast , southeast and midwest within the next couple of ferc meetings . wood also stated that it is time for rto west and desert star to "" marry up , "" meaning , i suppose , that the two should consolidate . wood does not think that california can be included in the western rto yet since it has lingering problems . structural effort : the commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in order no . 2000 into rto structures . to achieve this goal , the commission is establishing an "" rto week "" of advanced workshops , from october 15 - 19 , in advance of issuing a nopr , to address structural issues such as : congestion management ; cost recovery ; market monitoring ; transmission planning ; reliability ; transmission rights . wood also envisions that the commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing order no . 888 transmission tariff . the new tariff will apply to all public utilities and rtos . wood also recognized that some "" sticks "" are needed to entice rto participation . therefore , wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by december 15 , 2001 with a declaration to join an rto . if they do not make this declaration , these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis . furthermore , wood states that if entities do not join rtos , they should not be authorized to merge their facilities , and that ferc will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by rtos . wood states that these "" sticks "" provide incentive , but do not mandate , rto participation . with regard to the pending requests for rehearing , wood asked legal staff to figure out how "" ferc can get there . "" in other words , i think wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing . while commissioner breathitt is skeptical about some of these rto proposals , because she was not required to vote on anything today , she only expressed her concern . upcoming dates october 15 - 19 - - rto workshops end of october - - further orders on northeast , southeast , midwest rtos december 15 , 2001 - - all public utilities must commit to an rto or have their market based rates revoked proposed rule for standards of conduct within the next few days , ferc will be issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking ( "" nopr "" ) on standards of conduct for transmission providers . as explained at the meeting ( we do not have a copy of the nopr yet ) , the nopr will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly . the nopr also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates , not just marketers . the standards of conduct would not apply to rtos and transmission providers who are members of an rto may ask for an exemption from the standards . the nopr will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission - owners ' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers . as you know , the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of tos that are only buying and selling power for native load customers . as the interim general counsel noted , these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the to . there was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load . staff told the commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules . pat wood said they will include the proposal in the nopr ( breathitt may not support ) , but if the industry does not support the proposal , ferc will pull it . we of course will strongly support the proposal . provision of adequate electrical capacity ( icap ) chairman wood asked staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements . wood noted that the commission had to issue an order on icap in new england during their recess in august , and he is not that familiar with the issues . therefore , he asked staff to prepare a presentation , which they made at the meeting this morning . the presentation will be made public within the next couple of days . in sum , staff seems to believe that some type of icap requirement is needed for reliability . after the presentation , wood noted that the new england icap order has enough wiggle room to allow the commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue . wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized , competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply ( without politically unacceptable , prolonged price spikes ) . commissioner brownell ( from the pennsylvania puc ) has a better understanding of icap and expressed concerns that icap may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers . realizing that there are many positions on this topic , chairman wood said he will publish the staff report and ask for comments by october 17 . we will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process . sorry this is so long , but a lot happened today . we will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over . let us know if you have any questions . sarah",0,Safe,zefang_phishing_email_dataset,0,email,True

    DanQ> I think it would make more sense to start Habeas with a less
    DanQ> aggressive score (one which will not give spammers a quick path
    DanQ> into everyone's inbox) and after we've seen evidence that the
    DanQ> system works, then we can increase the magnitude of the score.Better yet, let the GA figure out the correct score. ;-) That will obviously
take awhile since you'll have to acquire enough messages with it, but it
should give you a good idea if the presence of Habeus headers are good spam
indicators or not.  If they are, my guess is that Habeus will probably not
succeed.Taking things further off-topic: Does Habeus charge a license fee to
organizations who want to use their copyrighted material or is their sole
revenue stream to come from legal judgements?  On the one hand, if they
charge license fees, I'd worry that when times got tough they'd be somewhat
less critical of organizations we'd call spammers today in order to generate
license fees.  If not, I'd worry the pendulum would swing the other way and
they'd go after legitimate businesses in an attempt to generate more
revenues from judgements and/or out of court settlements.  Either way, it
seems like they have an interesting tightrope to walk.--

The problem has now been isolated and HP has been preparing a fix, which will be available within the next 48 hours.3) We won't comment on the specifics of our discussions with SnoSoft. However, we take our customers' security requirements very seriously and have a strong track record following industry-standard security practices.4) Where and how the DMCA should be applied is a matter of great controversy. The reported letter to SnoSoft was not consistent or indicative of HP's policy. We can say emphatically that HP will not use the DMCA to stifle research or impede the flow of information that would benefit our customers and improve their system security.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Robin D.

TextAloud MP3 converts text to speech and to MP3 
Listen to email, Web pages, e-books, and more on your PC or 
portable MP3 player.  As featured in PC Magazine, The New 
York Times, and on CNN.  Now available with optional
AT&T Natural Voices, the most advanced computer speech for your PC. 
Listen to a demo, then 
download your trial copy.
Lockergnome's Guide to Converting Vinyl LPs to CD is no longer free. 
Over the last 10 days, almost 4,000 people downloaded the free tome. 
Of that 4,000, close to half put in a fake e-mail address, resulting 
in a ridiculous number of bounce messages in my inbox. Add to that 
the fact that several of the clever individuals used other people's 
real addresses, which then amounted to complaints of spam from the 
address owners. It's not worth providing a free service if it causes 
Lockergnome to be labeled a spammer as a result. The crowning gem was 
the in-duh-vidual who used the name A** Hole and Chris's personal 
address to download the PDF. On a more positive note, the guide is 
now available in all six formats,  
for the minimal price of $5, complete with some additional content 
based on a couple reader suggestions.Chris may have an obsession with Peets coffee, but I'll bet he's never 
been the daily special. On my visit to St. Louis, for the 
SIC, I 
started every morning with a walk to the West Port Starbucks. 
Apparently my morning ritual was a source of entertainment for the 
employees, which evolved into discussions of a reality based TV show 
based on the concept of stalking me. I've even got the 
incriminating evidence 
to prove it.The SIC provided me the opportunity to see some cool updates to a couple 
titles, in addition to being introduced to some useful audio oriented 
titles I'd never seen before. Expect a number of reviews over the next 
several weeks, as well as extensive coverage of last week's events in 
St. Louis in the annual SIC special issue. Lori managed to score a few 
more Gnomedex giveaways while we were in attendance, so those of you who 
sign up will be coming home with even more goodies, which, by the way, 
aren't of the stressball and pen variety -- we're talking software 
titles with reg codes.

DreamQuest Championship Card Games
For Pocket PC, Palm, Symbian OS
http://www.dq.com/palm.htmlPlaying games on a PDA has killed plenty of my time spent waiting in 
airports around the US. With the recent porting of these three classic 
PC card games from DreamQuest, I've added some of the best in PC 
entertainment to my arsenal of PDA diversions. Hearts, Spades and Euchre 
all play in a similar manner to their PC versions, only on a smaller 
screen. Available for Pocket PC, Palm, and even the Symbian OS, you can 
play cards against computer opponents or connect to the online game room 
and challenge other players using any of the games multiple platforms. 
This is a unique experience currently unavailable for any other pocket games. Â GnomeSKIN

Rexway

Blending punk rock attitude with country twang makes for a fairly 
unique musical experience. I saw these guys play a show in Omaha, 
back in January of this year and was blown away by their stage 
presence. Rexway rip through an opening set with enough energy to 
kick-start even the most somber crowd, moving everyone in the 
audience to their feet and setting the scene for an entertaining 
evening. As with most punk, the lyrics are equal parts politics 
and angst, with enough colorful language to drop a jaw or two. 
Tool fans should check out the countrified version of the classic 
HWAP; it's kind of like a cover tune, only more unique. If you 
are offended by 4-letter words, this band isn't for you.

Click for DetailsCroupier (NR) 1998
Drama - 94min
Reviewer's Tilt (9)Special DVD Features worth a look-Deleted scenesIn disembodied first person Clockwork style narration,  Croupier
pessimistically compares our lives to those of hapless casino gamblers.
We know the odds are stacked against us, yet we continue to play the
games. Gamblers, or ""punters"" as they are more derogatorily known,
however, play their games under the watchful eyes of the croupier
(casino dealer).  Constantly pulled by the siren song of fast money, the
croupier knows better than anyone that to play is to lose. Thus, the
cool croupier relegates himself to his addiction of watching others
lose. Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is the croupier, raised by his croupier
father (Nicholas Ball) who taught him all the tricks of the trade.
Through his losses both in the casino and in his personal life, Jack's
father also taught Jack that the only way to win is not to play. Punters
are sorry sods; the croupier is king. From father to son, the lesson
passes -- watching others strive and falter is the only real enjoyment
in life. Despite decades of croupier training, Jack is compelled to
write the great novel burning deep inside him, yearning to escape.
Jack's publisher regrettably relates to Jack that his novel idea is
trite; stories of real life graft and corruption are what sell. When
Jack's father informs Jack of a casino opening in a small London Casino,
Jack snatches the opportunity to parlay his skill into a novel exposing
the seedy underbelly of London's casinos. Unfortunately, Jack's ex-cop
girlfriend sees the job hardening and irreparably changing Jack for the
worst. In an attempt to fool himself, Jack creates alter ego ""Jake"" to
bear the brunt of inequity, attempting to maintain Jack both morally and
physically unscathed. The absence of any clear delineation between the
personas becomes apparent when a lovely punter (Alex Kingston)
approaches Jack with a scheme to rob the casino. Jack slowly comes to
the realization that no one can have it both ways, either in the casino
or in life. You are either in the game, or you are not. Seasoned veteran
director Michael Hodges deftly crafts this tale around the subtle
talents of the ultra cool Clive Owen. Owen rules this drama, not with
flex and volume, but with glances and nods. Less is truly more, much
more, in this low budget escape from the unsatisfying blockbuster
suspense films of recent memory. Croupier proves that it is not a large
budget, but direction, dialogue and acting that drive the genre.

software is not a product which is sold but a service which is licensed - at
least that's what I remember reading about how M$ gets away with providing
no guarantee in the U.S. If you're feeling rather deep pocketed, you could
always try suing M$ to get a court's view on the matter.

um.. http://wwws.sun.com/software/star/gnome/ integrated into solaris.Of course then there's http://wwws.sun.com/software/solaris/freeware/ for

Out of curiosity, does `normal fashion` mean that you still have to do the 
interactive customisations or is it like Solaris jumpstart where you can 
specify everything on the install server, do `boot net - install` go home, and 
come in to a fully installed and patched desktop the next morning?> There are minor problems: like the serial console drivers, but for workstation

I don't see why this should be a _major problem. The prom (ie the ""ok"" prompt) 
is almost at the hardware level and hence dosent depend on the os so you 
should be able to connect to that easily enough. Once the machine is installed 
cant you just log in over the network? The network is the computer after all

hmm... I'm not familiar with wyse stuff, but I only need to use the console 
when something breaks, then anything capable of something basic like vt100 at 
9600 8n1 seems to work  . Not sure why you'd need to worry about this much 
really, just set up jumpstart to install automatically then you don't need to 
look at the console at all.Cheers,

"URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/04.html#history_of_the_tilde
Date: 2002-10-04T00:27:41-05:00So I was researching the history of the tilde, because D told me that her 
company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any URL with a 
tilde in it. Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with 
remarkable accuracy a personal site, and apparently her employer believes that 
reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time. Which, to be 
honest, is probably accurate, given the nature of her work. But never mind 
that. I don't want to talk about corporate politics. I want to talk about the 
tilde. Every command-line-loving geek will tell you that ~ stands for â€œhome 
directoryâ€, and cd ~ will take you to your home directory. (cd ~username 
will take you to someone else's, except on Mac OS X, where it will take you to 
their Public file sharing directory.) It is from this heritage that we can 
trace the present-day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal 
pages, since one single system-wide configuration allowed individual users to 
have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. Or, more 
commonly now that Apache has taken over the world, in their public_html 
subdirectory, except on Mac OS X, where if you turn on web sharing and point 
your browser to http://localhost/~username/, you're actually being served files 
from that user's Sites directory within their home directory. But I don't want to talk about Mac OS X. I want to talk about the tilde. As with so many other things, I find that Jukka Korpela[1] is the expert in 
this field. Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass[2], a word which Google (
old habits die hard[3]) feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene 
Wallingford, which, like Jukka's home page, can not be referenced without a 
tilde. In fact, Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be 
used in URLs[4], a treatise which, I feel obliged to point out, contains a 
tilde in its URL. Clearly, the tilde is underappreciated. Digging further, we find this post of Jukka's from 1998[5], in which we learn 
that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all, but rather an odd 
character called the overline. Presumably to balance out the underline, if 
indeed those sorts of things require balance. There is balance in the universe, 
to be sure, but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard. No matter. 
The tilde was the tilde so that Spanish-typing types could type the Ã± 
(now referenced in HTML as the named entity Ã±), but somewhere along 
the line, it morphed into a general-purpose character with all sorts of geeky 
uses. Digging even further, it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for 
#[6], then an alternate for ^, and its life as an overline replacement came 
even later. Jukka confirms this[7] and adds a timeline: 1963 for #, 1964 for ^, 
1966 for overline. Then June 30, 1966, the watershed moment in an X3 committee 
meeting, when it was proposed â€œas exclusively a tilde in USA to appease 
SHAREâ€. I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means, or 
what this committee meeting was about. The next reference isn't until 1991, 
when the tilde was officially added to ISO-646[8]. And now, down the rabbit hole we go. Scouring Usenet (which the kids of 
yesterday called â€œDeja Newsâ€, and kids today call â€œGoogle 
Groupsâ€), we find a reprint of a 1991 William Safire (yes, _that_ William 
Safire) article On Language[9], in which we learn that ~ is officially 
pronounced â€œsquiggleâ€. This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary
[10] to this very day. I'm not sure this is useful, but I just thought it was 
cool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various 
ASCII characters. As early as August 1990, tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem
[11]. In July 1989, Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde[12]. In February 1988, an editor's note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that 
Fidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde[13]. As early as January 1987, less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF[14]. As early as July 1986, troff supported the tilde[15]. In November 1985, a mod.sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements 
(history,tilde,job control)[16]. As early as January 1984, tilde was included on the DEC keyboard[17] and listed 
in the APL-11 character set[18]. In April 1983, tilde was causing bugs in vi[19] (actually due to underlying 
bugs in csh). In December 1982, ~ is officially pronounced â€œtildeâ€[20], prompting 
this typographical pun[21]. And that's the earliest reference I can find. So where does that leave us? Unsatisfied, no doubt. There is history here, but 
there are gaps. What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966? How did the 
tilde rise to prominence in the 1980s? When did it become a synonym for 
â€œhome directoryâ€? When did it migrate into the world of web servers 
to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web 
sites? I don't know, and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing 
my research, a failing for which I apologize profusely. Goodnight, goodnight.

Vast Detail on Towers' Collapse May Be SealedSeptember 30, 2002
By JAMES GLANZ and ERIC LIPTON 
 What is almost certainly the most sophisticated and
complete understanding of exactly how and why the twin
towers of the World Trade Center fell has been compiled as
part of a largely secret proceeding in federal court in
Lower Manhattan. Amassed during the initial stages of a complicated
insurance lawsuit involving the trade center, the
confidential material contains data and expert analysis
developed by some of the nation's most respected
engineering minds. It includes computer calculations that
have produced a series of three-dimensional images of the
crumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit,
helping to identify the sequence of failures that led to
the collapses. An immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of the
debris piles, rare photos and videos, has also been
accumulated in a collection that far outstrips what
government analysts have been able to put together as they
struggle to answer the scientifically complex and
emotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly
failures of the buildings. But everyone from structural engineers to relatives of
victims fear that the closely held information, which
includes the analysis and the possible answers that
families and engineers around the world have craved, may
remain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed. Bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, the
experts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they
wait for the case to play out. Such restrictions are
typical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as it
now stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed that
certain material can remain secret for the time being - has
approved standard legal arrangements that, should the
lawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucial
material generated by the competing sides to be withheld. ""We're obviously in favor of releasing the information, but
we can't until we're told what to do,"" said Matthys Levy,
an engineer and founding partner at Weidlinger Associates,
who is a consultant in the case and the author of ""Why
Buildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail"" (Norton, 2nd
edition, 2002). ""Let's just say we understand the mechanics of the whole
process"" of the collapse, Mr. Levy said. Monica Gabrielle, who lost her husband, Richard, when the
south tower fell and who is a member of the Skyscraper
Safety Campaign, said the information should be disclosed.
""If they have answers and are not going to share them, I
would be devastated,"" Mrs. Gabrielle said. ""They have a
moral obligation."" The lawsuit that has generated the information involves
Larry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on the
trade center property, and a consortium of insurance
companies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetliner
that hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist
attack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than half
that amount, as the insurance companies say. As both sides have prepared their arguments, they have
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert
opinion about exactly what happened to the towers. Dean Davison, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers of
Hartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, said
of the findings, ""There are some confidentiality agreements
that are keeping those out of the public domain today."" He
conceded that differing opinions among the more than 20
insurers on his side of the case could complicate any
release of the material. As for his own company, whose consultants alone have
produced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of
diagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attempt
would be made to give the material eventually to ""public
authorities and investigative teams."" Still, some of that analysis relies on information like
blueprints and building records from other sources, like
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built
and owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein in
the suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how the
differing origins of the material would influence his
company's ability to release information. In a statement, the Port Authority said access to documents
would be ""decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with
applicable law and policy,"" adding that it would cooperate
with ""federal investigations."" The fate of the research is particularly critical to
resolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell,
given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into
the buildings' collapse. That investigation, led by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by few
resources, a lack of access to crucial information like
building plans, and infighting among experts and officials.
A new federal investigation intended to remedy those
failings has just begun at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, or NIST, an agency that has
studied many building disasters. Officials with NIST have said it could take years to make
final determinations and recommendations for other
buildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speeded
up with access to the analysis done by the consultants on
the lawsuit. Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said of
the real estate executive's own heavily financed
investigative work, ""We decline to comment other than to
say that Silverstein is cooperating fully with the NIST
investigation."" A spokesman for the agency confirmed it was
in discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, but
said no transfer had taken place. With no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by
both sides in the legal case have produced a startling body
of science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the
trade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. ""The work should be available to other investigators,"" said
Ramon Gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partner
at Gilsanz Murray Steficek, who was a member of the earlier
inquiry. ""It could be used to build better buildings in the
future."" Legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one
governing the material can lead to a variety of outcomes,
from full or partial disclosure to destruction of such
information. In some cases, litigants who paid for the
reports may make them public themselves. Or they may ask to
have them sealed forever. 
""It is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep
some of those documents secret for one reason or another,
some legitimate, some not,"" said Lee Levine, a First
Amendment lawyer at Levine Sullivan & Koch in Washington. Mr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of the
information, the court might look favorably on requests to
make it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of the
material is unnerving to many people, especially experts
who believe that only a complete review of the evidence -
not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect
their own interests - could lead to an advance in the
federal investigation of the trade center. ""It's important for this to get presented and published and
subjected to some scrutiny,"" said Dr. John Osteraas,
director of civil engineering practice at Exponent Failure
Analysis in Menlo Park, Calif., and a consultant on the
case, ""because then the general engineering community can
sort it out."" The scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by
any measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at Weidlinger
Associates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have called
upon powerful computer programs, originally developed with
the Pentagon for classified research, to create a model of
the Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. The result is a compilation of three-dimensional images of
the severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged
core of the towers, beginning with the impacts and
proceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images -
which Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helped
pinpoint the structural failures. The FEMA investigators did not have access to such computer
modeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access to
the trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeks
immediately after the attacks. But no such constraints
hampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought to
the site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of
Sept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and a
consultant to Silverstein Properties on the case, said he
had assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground
zero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how
the towers fell. Though the FEMA team could not determine ""where things
actually fell,"" Mr. Cuoco said, ""we've indicated the
specific locations."" Mr. Cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details
of the findings. Nor would Mr. Osteraas discuss the details
of computer calculations his company has done on the spread
of fires in large buildings like the twin towers. Mr.
Osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of
photographs and videos of the towers that day, some of
which he believes have not been available to other
investigators. And the investigation has not limited itself to computers
and documentary evidence. For months, experiments in wind
tunnels in the United States and Canada have been examining
the aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed
the weakening structures. Jack Cermak, president of Cermak Peterka Peterson in Fort
Collins, Colo., was retained by the insurance companies but
had previously performed wind-tunnel studies for the
original design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. For
the legal case, Dr. Cermak said, ""we've done probably more
detailed measurements than in the original design."" ""The data that have been acquired are very valuable in
themselves for understanding how wind and buildings
interact,"" Dr. Cermak said. ""Some of the information may be
valuable for the litigation,"" he said, adding, ""I think
I've told you all I can.""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/30/nyregion/30TOWE.html?ex=1034388663&ei=1&en=0d3143a997e5e2e1HOW TO ADVERTISE

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!
 
INSTRUCTIONS:
 
=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====
 
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.
 
===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.
 
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.
 
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it.
 
Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
 
Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:
 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
==================================================
 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.
 
Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.
 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.
 
Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.
 
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.
 
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).
 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00
 
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! 
==================================================
 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?
 
There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!
 
METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
==================================================
 
Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.
 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.
 
===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.
 
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
 
=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.
 
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.
 
** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.
 
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work.
 
Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""
 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.
 
The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""
 
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""
 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. 
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

"sum : computer transcription a couple of months ago , i asked the members of this list for help regarding software for the transcription of spoken discourse . i received a large number of answers , some to my personal e-mail address , some ' public ' . in the following i shall quote some of the answers and attempt to sum up what i consider to be the most important info received on the matter : perhaps slightly off the subject a few answers spoke of the possibilities for machine-readable text : quote : ' a company named norris communication ( san diego , ca ) sells a digital recorder that breaks down audio input into machine readable code ( including ascii i assume ) ' ' norris is reputed to be only one of two companies in the usa ( maybe the world ) manufacturing digital audio recorders using so-called "" flash chips "" ( semiconductor memory chips that permit both read and write functions ) . the digitized flash memory can be "" dumped "" to a pc in machine readable code ( which i assume would include ascii compatibility - - that 's my assumption ) . i do n't have an address , but i got their telephone number from directory assistance . the company is located in a suburb of san diego , california called poway , california . the listed telephone number is 619-679 - 1504 . if that does n't work for some reason , directory assistance can be reached at 619-555 - 1212 . ' a number of answers centered around using standard word processors ' macro facilities : quote : ' i used to do this quite satisfactorily on the pc using ms word with glossary items to quickly input speaker identification , special character sequences , etc . use a style sheet for controlling formatting . i imagine that word perfect for the pc can do the same thing , especially with its macros . ' ' i ' ve made a set of macro 's which operate on a standardized form to facilitate the transcribing process . essentially what i did is simply reduce all routinely occurring series of keystrokes to one alt - or control - key . ' most transcription software seems to be available for the mac : quote : ' for the macintosh i would definitely use nisus with a macro that has been assigned a short and easy to type keyboard shortcut . from little things like this to far more complex tasks , nisus is amazing . it is truly the power user 's and linguist 's word processor of choice . from what i have seen , it is also the most worldscript - savvy word processor available . if you have n't seen it , check out the new nisuswriter 4 . 0 which should be shipping very soon if not already .

"workshop annoncement and call for papers - clitics workshop announcement and call for papers c l i t i c s 24th - 26th february 1999 konstanz university , germany we are pleased to announce our workshop on ' clitics ' during the 21st annual meeting of the german society of linguistics in konstanz ( germany ) . in linguistic research , clitics play an increasingly prominent role . the status of clitics is under discussion in phonology , morphology , and syntax , as well as in the respective interfaces . in these fields , the discussion on clitics gives rise to controversial analyses . one open question is whether we need in fact a separate linguistic category ' clitic ' , or whether these elements can be subsumed under different linguistic categories , such as affixes . - with respect to phonology , it is undetermined how clitics are incorporated into phonological structure . should we distinguish a clitic group in the prosodic hierarchy , are clitics part of prosodic words , or are they left outside prosodic structure ? how is their phonological deficiency best accounted for ? - concerning the morphology of clitics , especially regarding the occurrence of opaque clitics in clitic clusters , analyses within the framework of distributed morphology compete with those which propose an optimality theoretic solution . - also , the morphosyntactic status of clitics is unclear . is it possible to capture the order of clitics in clitic clusters in a more explanatory way than in terms of templates ? the complex conditions on clitic doubling give rise to the question whether clitics should be analysed as agreement markers or as arguments . - syntactic aspects of clitics play a major role in recent analyses in different theoretical frameworks . for instance , there is no agreement on the explanation of clitic climbing and it is an unsettled issue whether clitic placement should be accounted for in a syntactic , prosodic , prosodic-syntactic , or optimality-theoretic approach . the workshop intends to bring together phonologists , morphologists , and syntacticians and provides an ideal opportunity to share insights and to discuss the issues mentioned above . in addition to the invited speaker presentations , there are 9 slots for 30 - minute presentations , and 3 slots for 1 hour presentations ( including discussion ) . invited speakers : geert booij ( free university amsterdam ) jane grimshaw ( rutgers university ) juan uriagereka ( university of maryland ) please send a one-page abstract before 15th august 1998 to : birgit gerlach & janet grijzenhout , seminar fuer allgemeine sprachwissenschaft , heinrich - heine - universitaet , universitaetsstr . 1 , 40225 duesseldorf , germany . we may be contacted by e-mail at gerlach @ phil-fak . uni-duesseldorf . de , or grijzenh @ phil-fak . uni-duesseldorf . de",0,Safe,zefang_phishing_email_dataset,0,email,True

Vipul Ved Prakash said:> Are there any suggestions for ""fixing"" this in razor-agents? razor-agents

Razor and handled gracefully (logging to syslog or /dev/null), it'd be a
great help.As it stands, if the log file is unwritable, the razor check falls over
entirely as the constructor returns undef (unblessed reference = 'die'
error in perl).--j.

indestructible.  I hacked a headphone jack into it and gave it to him.  He
complained of it's looks but used it nonetheless.  I also gave him a pack of
headphones as there's no such things indestuctible headphones that aren't

!==================================================BE IN GOOD MONEY WITHIN A YEAR!!!Before 
you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been 
hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the 
Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the 
investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make 
people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was 
legal.Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely 
NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow 
the simple instructions, they are bound to make some money with only $25 out of 
pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT 
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED,Â  IT IS 
CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.This is what one had to say: 
""I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am 
so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the 
minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total 
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."" Pam Hedland, Fort

is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long time 
but I never believed in it. But one day when I received it again in the mail I 
decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa 
.... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. Â The first month 
I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of 
$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have 
made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this 
program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.""More

GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS:=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below 
=====For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE 
REPORTYOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name 
appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON 
YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.=== When 
you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.Â  You will need all 5 reports so that you 
can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 
5=$25.00.Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 
reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they 
will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case 
something happens to your computer.IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of 
the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in 
any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you 
will lose out on a majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this 
works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this 
method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT work !!! People have 
tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get 
all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to 
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than 
what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you.Â  Remember, honesty reaps the 
reward!!!1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this

Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your 
computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just 
in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the 
internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing 
information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find 
thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to 
get this venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL 
LEGALLY==========================================================Let's 
say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume 
You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that 
the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but 
lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of 
thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).Continuing with this example, 
you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders 
for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail 
each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with 
orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 
people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.Â  The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders 
for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total 
of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for 
Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total 
of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders 
for Report #5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half 
million).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 
+ 3..... $5,000 + 4.... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000Â  
Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A 
PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW 
YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY 
!=========================================================REMEMBER 
FRIENDS, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED 
TO.Â  Dare to think for a moment what 
would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 
e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet 
worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and 
more!METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE 
INTERNET=======================================================Advertising 
on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to 
advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger 
response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as 
you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the 
Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on 
it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the 
report.=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================ORDER EACH 
REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) 
for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by 
wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, 
Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL 
ADDRESS and your name and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE

the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !============ MORE TESTIMONIALS 
================""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in 
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good 
money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk 
mail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spouting my knowledge of the population 
and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my 
supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made 
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when 
the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had 
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 
147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 
''hobby''.Â  Mitchell Wolf M.D., 
Chicago, 
Illinois======================================================''Not 
being the gambling type, it took several weeks to make up my mind to participate 
in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment 
was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at 
least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post 
office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The 
nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There 
simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.""Â  Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, 
Canada=======================================================''I 
had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should 
have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another 
copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 
months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made 
more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks.""Â  Susan De Suza, New York, 
N.Y.=======================================================''It 
really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to 
you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money 
started to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third 
month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to 
internet."".Â  Fred Dellaca, Westport,

Adam-fantasy.  Women actually are allowed to do things productive,
independent and entirely free of their male counterparts.  They aren't
forced to cook and clean and merely be sexual vessels.   Sometimes,
and this will come as a shock to you, no doubt, men and women even
find -love- (which is the crucial distinction between this system) and
they marry one another for the satisfaction of being together.   I
know, far-fetched and idealistically crazy as it is, but such things
do happen.   I can guarantee you, if my mother was approached by my
father, and 25 years ago, he commented on her cleaning ability as a
motivator for marrying her, we would not be having this conversation
now.If guys still have silly antequated ideas about 'women's role' then
their opportunities for finding women _will_ be scarce.   Again, these
situations are great, provided everyone is aware that the relationship
is a contractual one -- he wants a maid, a dog and a prostitute he
doesn't have to pay, and she wants a country that isn't impoverished
and teeming with AIDS.  A contract, versus a true love-interest
marriage.Egh.  I really need to stop analyzing your posts to this extent.   I

"midmonth report : early warning - cera alert note : the following was sent out by cera and has a short term forecast of prices and alternate fuel pricing . note the price differential forecasts by basin . cera alert : sent wed , november 15 , 2000 title : midmonth report : early warning author : n . american gas team e - mail category : alert product line : north american gas , url : http : / / www . cera . com / cfm / track / eprofile . cfm ? u = 5526 likewise , a 5 percent warmer - than - normal scenario could decrease demand by 1 . 7 bcf per day relative to normal weather . fuel switching with natural gas markets this tight , there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market . residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run , which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market . this winter we expect * all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so * a loss of 700 million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter * industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500 mmcf per day off of gas * gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices , as much as resid will act as a floor for gas for december cera expects an overall demand increase of 4 . 5 bcf per day relative to last december and a 14 . 4 bcf per day increase in demand relative to november , with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching . supply - the rebound the pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense , but us supply is beginning to rebound . the recent steep decline in us lower - 48 capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000 , given the soaring gas - related rig count . * the success in reversing the decline in the gulf of mexico is related to the combination of - the ramp - up of the hickory and tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf , adding to the recent startup of the muni field ; these fields could add over 0 . 5 bcf per day later in 2001 - the response of the shallow water to the strong late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity * other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater gulf of mexico , with 0 . 5 bcf per day in 2000 and 2001 , and onshore , led by the bossier sand play in freestone county , texas , the barnett shale play in wise county , texas , and the powder river basin coal seam play . * further increases in drilling are likely to slow . new deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs . producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews . regional markets - wild winter in the west extremely cold weather in the west has brought rockies prices close to parity with henry hub prices and triggered early season spikes at sumas in the north and topock in the south . pipeline maintenance on el paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to topock differentials of over $ 2 . 00 per mmbtu . tight pricing relationships to the henry hub in the san juan and rocky mountains should hold through february , with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline . winter has arrived in earnest across north america , but the start - up of firm transportation service on alliance is delayed once again , this time until december 1 . nonetheless , flows on the pipeline are under way ; cera estimates that flows during october averaged 450 mmcf per day . during november that total should climb to 750 mmcf per day , despite the later published start date . with or without alliance flows , a weather - driven rebound in midwestern demand relative to november and december last year should keep prices in chicago at a significant premium to henry hub prices . in the northeast , differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter , despite greater flows into the region from atlantic canada this year ( see table 3 ) . cera ' s outlook by region follows : * rockies . very cold weather within the region has brought rocky mountain prices near parity with henry hub prices . a break in the cold or a cold snap in the east will likely widen the differentials , but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu below the henry hub price . cera expects a december average differential of $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu ; however , this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather . a warm week in the rockies could still push differentials toward $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu . * san juan . san juan prices will continue to hold close to rockies prices through the winter , with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions . heating loads in the rockies will determine the san juan to henry hub differential , with extended cold weather in the rockies pulling both prices close to the henry hub price . cera expects the december differential in the san juan basin to average $ 0 . 20 per mmbtu . * permian and mid - continent . unlike prices within the rest of the west , differentials between the henry hub and the mid - continent and permian basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter , as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west , depending on regional weather . cera expects a permian to henry hub differential of $ 0 . 11 per mmbtu and a mid - continent differential of $ 0 . 08 per mmbtu for december . * chicago . alliance flows into the chicago market are now running close to 750 mmcf per day . however , the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed chicago differentials up to near $ 0 . 15 per mmbtu relative to the henry hub , despite delays in the completion of the vector pipeline . cera expects the strong pricing at chicago to continue , and december differentials should average $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu . * northeast markets . assuming normal weather , we expect to see december basis for new york relative to henry hub at $ 1 . 03 per mmbtu . new england will likely see prices $ 0 . 05 - $ 0 . 15 higher , depending on the pipeline . much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs . for example , with a 9 percent retention rate from the gulf coast into new england , last december would have seen retention costs of approximately $ 0 . 22 ; at $ 5 . 70 , that same retention equates to $ 0 . 50 . despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the northeast from the atlantic canadian fields , there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets , and an additional 166 , 000 mmbtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity . because of this tightness , should this month ' s weather be colder than normal , we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in january 2000 . these spikes could even exceed the highs seen in january , depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized . canadian markets - winter begins the colder - than - normal weather has increased demand in western canada but is only now being felt in the east . storage peaked in the west in early october at approximately 225 bcf below last year ' s level and 6 bcf below the five - year average . even with modest withdrawals since that time , storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs . easter canadian storage has continued to grow , pushing levels to over 245 bcf , 11 bcf above last year and well above the five - year average . with the eastward movement of the colder weather , withdrawals are likely to begin . this higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on transcanada . the good news resulting from the cold is a more normal "" freeze - up , "" which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season . gas well completions are expected to reach 8 , 500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next year . further delays for alliance ? the "" commercial "" in - service date for alliance has been delayed until december 1 , the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line , delays in the completion of the aux sable liquids extraction plant , the delay of vector , and a lack of supply . the pipeline has been flowing gas , however , with volumes building up since september . it is estimated that flows for november will average 750 mmcf per day . transcanada has taken the full brunt of the alliance flows so far , with northern border and pgt remaining strong . december should see alliance flows build to between 900 and 1 , 000 mmcf per day , with modest reductions in flows on northern border and pgt . storage withdrawals will likely keep transcanada reductions close to 350 mmcf per day , year - over - year , until vector begins service to eastern canada . high prices : strong pull west the high demand in the pacific northwest has also provided strength for aeco . the aeco - henry differential has dropped to the high $ 0 . 30 s and low $ 0 . 40 s as a result of this increased pull . for december , the differential is expected to average $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu , for a resulting aeco average of c $ 6 . 97 per gigajoule ( us $ 5 . 10 per mmbtu ) . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this message with associated tables . cera ' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http : / / www . cera . com / event account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e - mail address , etc . go to : http : / / eprofile . cera . com / cfm / edit / account . cfm this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

 Dear Readers,Your ISP, if it's anything like mine, works like a very large
boat: It moves slowly, it turns slowly, and sometimes it leaks.
Take rogue wireless networks, for example. For many months now,
some mischievous entrepreneurs have been hacking into major ISP
networks and siphoning off bandwidth for neighborhood wireless
networks. Only now, months later, are broadband bigwigs doing
something about it. And what
about ISP hackers? Could they break into your service provider?
Probably. Thankfully, you can protect yourself against most of
these leaks. Let Dan Tynan, our ISP guru, show you how. Quick links to Services & Prices from these companies

coal and emissions trading the first enron online synfuel trade occurred this past week , establishing enrononline as the only online marketplace for synfuel . the purpose of bringing synfuel on enrononline is to provide market transparency between the coal / synfuel spread . the coal cash book , which began trading only two months ago , has traded over 2 million spot tons . the fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies , while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing of coal . enron energy and operational services - ena solid fuel initiative ena started development of a coal initiative late last year to support the electricity trading desk and to provide enron with a hedge in the event that the cost of natural gas continues to escalate above current long term projections . because of the culture shock associated the use of the words ' enron ' and ' coal ' in the same sentence , consideration was been given to changing the name to dng ( dense natural gas ) ; however , we went with solid fuel initiative . this initiative is developing multiple sites throughout the country where ena feels there is the greatest opportunity for long term corporate benefit . the primary areas are texas , florida , southeastern ohio and the central rocky mountain area . there are 2 principal areas currently being aggressively pursued : brownsville , tx and brighton fl . in brownsville , the team secured formal owner approval to lease a 600 acre site near the brownsville ship channel . this approval will allow the formal permitting activities to proceed without delay . a 500 mw facility is being considered for brownsville . as conceptualized , it will consist of two - 250 mw ( net ) cfb units ( circulating fluidized bed ) boilers . the boilers will be fired by petroleum coke ( petcoke ) and use a technology that will generate electricity in the most environmentally friendly way currently possible . one of the advantages of locating this facility near brownsville is that it remains a steady growth area and there is already serious interest by others to take substantial initial base load capacity . there is further synergy with other developing projects in the area that could lock down additional base capacity . as stated the plant is initially 500 mw , but will be designed to be expanded to a 1000 mw facility . the eeos team is starting to grow and currently includes hilda akin & cheryl kent , project admin assistants , bill fox as pem , and paula solomon as pcm . as the project develops there will be more team members required . in addition , as the florida opportunity develops we plan to establish a separate team . esource esource , enron ' s research group , recently posted on its website a forrester report as well as analyst reports for various industry and companies . these reports are free and available to all enron employees on the esource hot topics page at http : / / esource . enron . com / hot _ topics . asp . to date , over 1 , 600 employees have downloaded "" spending wisely on private hubs "" , a report valued at $ 2 , 000 . over 1 , 100 employees to date have viewed the analyst reports , provided by investext . the reports , which are updated continuously , are presented in folders by company and industry . new folders are being added upon request . to submit a suggestion for a new folder , please complete the suggestion form at http : / / esource . enron . com / suggestion . asp . watch for the new esource bulletin , the source . it will feature frequently requested searches , tips on finding information , new products , services , and events . meanwhile , to further fulfill enron ' s information needs , esource has arranged for analysts and bureau chiefs of various organizations and publishing houses to offer seminars to enron employees . enron freight markets efm signed a firm contract with streamline shippers association last week to provide truckload capacity for one - year with efm ' s option to extend the contract for up to an additional year . streamline transloads international shipments that enter the u . s . through the ports of long beach and los angeles . streamline then consolidates the shipments into full truckloads destined to the major population centers throughout the country . efm will begin moving shipments to northeast destinations this week . in the news we are pleased to announce that sally beck has been named chief operating officer for enron net works . she will join greg piper , president and chief executive officer and mark pickering , chief technology officer in the enron net works office of the chair . in her current role as managing director for enron net works , sally heads up enron ' s global risk management operations . she brings more than 20 years professional experience to enron , joining the company in 1992 . she graduated from the university of texas at austin with a b . b . a . in marketing and an mba with a concentration in finance . welcome new hires egm -

the French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.""
Origins:   Yet another French fried ""George W. Bush is dumb""
story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures
drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that
emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President
Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,
the decline of the French economy. ""The problem with the
French,"" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, ""is that they don't
have a word for entrepreneur.""The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness
Williams of Crosby, who claimed ""my good friend Tony Blair"" had
recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. ""I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,""
Campbell told The Post. ""If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke.""This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of
a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than
stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories
too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've
chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the
moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the
ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged
as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the
intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus
quatrain which pontificated that the ""village idiot"" would win
the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it
was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks
to chortling up their sleeves.Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual
shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they
seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this
public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever
been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at
some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always
fall upon appreciative ears.Barbara ""ears of corn"" MikkelsonLast updated:   29 July 2002http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0,Safe,zefang_phishing_email_dataset,0,email,True

( pti ) the economic times , friday apr 27 2001 mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dabhol . "" we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh "" , a senior mseb official said . "" we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members "" , mseb sources said . last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept "" protest payments "" anymore . cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the "" purported protest or reservation "" . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government . ( pti ) business standard , friday , april 27 , 001 enron india md authorised to terminate ppa the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government . "" the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises , "" a state government source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders . the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of the board ' s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice . the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the enron board ' s "" enabling resolution "" did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract . enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party . the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills . after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty . "" this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting "" , a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on . the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001 foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan global banks comfortable with enron pull - out lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot . international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical that additional assistance to dpc ' s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the authorisation given to enron india ' s managing director k wade cline and dpc president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer notices to mseb , following wednesday ' s dpc board meeting in london . the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc ' s debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is . however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a messy affair . sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security - other than assets - like a sovereign cover . "" it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5 per cent , "" a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a ) there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power . while local lenders led by idbi - with mseb parroting the same - were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets - even those under phase - i - getting attached . therefore , an examination on the segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted . pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday . the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp , has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india ' s managing director k wade cline to serve a ' ' preliminary ' ' termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24 million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on thursday . the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision as a ' ' procedural ' ' move consistent with dpc ' s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb . after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated , the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty . ' ' our ( centre ' s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million , ' ' power secretary a k basu said . ' ' contractually , the centre will have to pay one year ' s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore , and take over dpc ' s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project was terminated , ' ' basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which is 95 per cent through . while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had strongly opposed dpc ' s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination . mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar - both directors on the dpc board - and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly ' ' threatening ' ' to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra - a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war , coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc ' s move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers . the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001 offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa . as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some arm - twisting . at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon . the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation . echo in ls the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister , mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . blow to fis the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the centre or the state . the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001 enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet , considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders ' consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project . the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move . another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms . institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package , which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings . ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , "" bansal added . ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' ' he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india , where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings . meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa . ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however , added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors . the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december 2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest payment , despite the dispute over the amount . when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc . the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001 dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official said . the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances . . . ' ' idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however , domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned mid - way . according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134 crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior mseb official said . the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication . the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of "" interested party "" . when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal , declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board . "" we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express our views after a few days , "" he said . however , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as "" unfortunate "" . "" we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision "" , mr deshmukh said in mumbai . official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb . "" if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb , the centre and the state government , "" the sources said . not surprisingly , the dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc . riday , april 27 the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron signal to switch off dabhol power enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company ' s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) . the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre ' s liability , if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year ' s power bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out . "" we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit , "" power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore ' protest payment ' by the cash - strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore . there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron ' s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide bandh . "" we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up at the dispute - resolution forum , "" a board official said . last week , dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position . mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre ' s and state ' s counter - guarantees , unlike those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron ' s decision unfortunate . "" we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties . "" the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron threatens to pull out the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9 billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of dabhol ' s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board , mr vinay bansal . while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu , who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday . the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation . however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the total of one years ' electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc ' s board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister , padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april . however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary . the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff , with enron ' s consent . among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however , they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march 2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put up a brave face on enron ' s decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported from new delhi . "" there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on fdi in power sector , "" power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when asked about dpc ' s decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision , prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs "" we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as european nations in the power sector . "" in fact not only the power minister but also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector . "" mid day ' dpc may not wind up ' maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor , managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given complete powers with regard to dpc ' s operations in the state , including the authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the meeting in london . with regard to the state ' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said , "" bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice . "" in the london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could not supply power whenever needed . chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to wind up operations . deshmukh added , "" we have already requested enron not to take any harsh decision . "" deshmukh had earlier said , "" we have directed state government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to both of us .

To explain what I mean:
According to the PGCC site, GCC by itself is not very good at taking 
advantage of the pipelining features introduced with the Pentium family. The 
PGCC patches are supposed to make GCC generate tighter code, but your point 
about compiler bugs is well taken. This is why I am taking things slow and 
looking into these things. As Isaid, the PGCC site does not seem to have been 
updated in at least a year or more?!? I am also looking into GCC itself. Now 
that the 3.1. series is out, it might be better than when the PGCC patches 
were written. The bottom line is, Pentiums have better instruction sets than 
the original 386 instructions that they still support. The Pentium also 
started introducing pipelining so properly generated code can be upto 30% 
faster than equivulent code that performs the same function! As for why 
optimise GCC if it will only produce that same code only slightly faster? The 
speed is based on a percentage of the total compile time. The first time I 
compiled the qt libs, with only 16M and a LOT of swap, it took over 48 hours. 
I've now got 128M in the box but at 200Mhz any increase, distributed over 
such a long compile is still considerable.> on the other side you can look into patches to gcc that affect it's

My understanding, and I've followed the development of the Intel family since 
the 8080, each generation since the 386 has introduced better and faster 
instructions. I.E.:
The 486 introduced I.E.E.E floating point instructions by incorporating an 
FPU on board. The first few generations were flaky, so Intel disabled the 
dodgy ones and sold then as 486SX, I.E. without the FPU. Later generations 
were better, this is why you only find slow 486SX's ;-) Therefore 486's, with 
working FPU's can calculate floats faster than 386's, but you must generate 
the proper codes to take advantage of this.The Pentium's improved the FPU logic and introduced pipelining. The first 
generations of Pentiums had faulty FPu logic programmed into them, the 
Pentium Bug, but subsequent ones were fine. These added instructions are 
faster again then the 486 equivulents. Also, the pipelining needs careful 
instruction ordering to take full advantage of it's speed improvements, 
again, something the compiler must know about to utilise to full effect. 
According the the PGCC site GCC does this poorly, but that info seems to be 
dated, GCC3.1.x might be better. This is one of the areas I am researching 
closely to get an answer.MMX added the ability to perform matrix calculations on int's with single 
instructions and using special DMA features within the Pentium to speed this 
up. Two problems with this:
1) int's are not very useful for most matrix calculations, floats would be 
betters.
2) this is not something that can be optimised well by a compiler. It need to 
be identified and provided for in the sources.
I.E. not much use to anyone, but makes great ad copy ;-)The PentiumPro improved the pipeline enormously. Again, a properly written 
compiler should be able to optimise for this, once it can organise the code 
properly.The PIII added MMX-type instructions for floats! Now this IS useful! 
Graphic-Intensive programs can take greate advantage of this, but it must be 
provided for in the source code. Compilers can not, usually optimise for this 
sort of thing. XFree86 and DRI are two prime examples that do provide for 
this, so the PIII can run XFree86 and DRI quite a bit faster, IF it's 
compiled for these SSE instructions!Not sure what improvements the P4 introduce? I think it's mostly just speed 
improvements rather than any execution changes.So, The difference between the 386 and the PentiumMMX 'should' yield a 
significant speed boost if optimised correctly. There are faster floating 
point instructions and pipelining that need optimising for. I'm not sure if 
GCC can optimise properly for the pipelining, at least the PGCC group found 
significant improvements to add to GCC2.95.3 to gain speed improvements of 
upto 30%. 30% of 48 hours is 14.4 hours. Of course none of this will have any 
effect on O/I bound processes but GUI's are mostly CPU bound. I am also 
finding out about object pre-linking optimisations which should give even 
better performance for QT and KDE.Now if I had another PIII for my box, I could take advantage of those SSE 
instructions to optimise XFree86 as well!> kevinAn, of course, I've loads of time on my hands now and I need something to 
keep me busy. At least I can say that I've sucessfully built a full Linux 
system, including KDE3 from scratch when I'm done ;-)

"ijcai95 workshop on context in nlp call for papers ijcai-95 workshop on context in natural language processing august 19 , 20 , or 21 , 1995 montreal , canada correct interpretation of natural language utterances and texts requires linguistic and non-linguistic context . the goal of this workshop is to investigate the nature of context in natural language , its role in natural language processing , and shed some light on this largely unexplored area of great theoretical and practical importance . dialogue and text processing are two application domains where the lack of good theories of context impedes significant progress in applying and developing new technologies . as speech technology matures , it becomes technically feasible to build dialogue systems . however , understanding dialogues , and especially multimodal dialogues , is not possible without some account of the role of context . similarly , with today 's text processing technology it is feasible to automatically create knowledge bases from fairly unconstrained texts such as newspaper archives . ignoring context in such texts , however , results in knowledge bases that are not only very incomplete , but also dramatically different from knowledge bases created by humans , based on the same texts . we invite papers from researchers active in the fields of natural language processing , knowledge representation , and other related areas addressing theoretical aspects of context and their implications for designing practical nlp systems . we are interested in reports on implemented nlp systems utilizing contextual information . we are also interested in knowledge representation systems , inference methods , and algorithms that would allow one to computationally handle specific aspects of context . agenda : our workshop will provide answers and insights into how to go about answering a number of questions , including the following : i : role of context in natural language what is context ? what is "" context of the previous utterance / sentence "" "" context of the dialog-so - far / text-so - far "" and what is the relationship between them ? how many different contexts are there ? what makes two contexts different ? what is the relationship between formalization of context and natural language ideas of context ? what is the status of context in a formal representation aiming at truthfully capturing all the characteristics of natural language ? is context an inherent characteristic of natural language that ultimately decides the formal power of natural language ? is natural language minus context a less powerful formal language ? does representing context and truthfully capturing characteristics of natural language require new knowledge representation or automated reasoning systems ? what is the relationship between context , and the semantics and pragmatics of natural language ? is context different from possible worlds and situations ? what is the relationship between domain ontologies and contexts ? ii : context-dependent interpretation of natural language in which way does context affect interpretation of natural language utterances and texts ? which aspects of context or which contexts result in refined , more general , and different interpretations of natural language ? which aspects of context are explicit and which are implicit in natural language utterances and texts ? which phenomena and inferences observed in natural language are context-independent and which ones always depend on context ? iii : computability does handling context increase or decrease computational complexity of natural language processing ? how to automatically identify context-provided constraints resulting in conveying and understanding additional or different aspects of information ? how to represent those extra constraints provided by context and how to automatically compute context-dependent interpretation of natural language ? should the final interpretation of natural language be decontextualized when stored in a knowledge base ? how can information obtained in one context be utilized in another , possibly unanticipated context ? workshop format : we will hold four sessions : i : role of context in natural language ii : context - dependent interpretation of natural language iii : computability iv : general discussion sessions i , ii , and iii will be mildly structured : first , the committee will present a brief overview of possible answers to the specific questions included in the agenda , and discuss their own answers . this presentation will be mixed with questions from the participants . second , the participants whose papers were accepted will briefly comment on their own answers to these questions . these presentations will also be mixed with questions from the participants . session iv , a general discussion , will give each participant a chance to make a statement about any context-related issue , make a comment , raise a question , argue for or against some answers etc . pre-worshop activities : a pre-workshop mailing list will be established ; please , indicate whether you want to be included ; in order to facilitate interaction and focus the discussion , two months before the workshop , we will provide all the participants with specific examples and data illustrating various aspects of context . authors + titles + abstracts of the accepted papers , but not the papers themselves , will be available on-line to everybody . the papers will only be available to the workshop participants . we hope that this will encourage people to make strong claims even if the support for them is not quite there , report on partial , ongoing , promising research , be frank in evaluating existing approaches and their own accomplishments , openly comment on limitations , in short , say all those ( very ) informative things that are sometimes difficult , if not impossible , to communicate in "" official "" publications . shared data , references , papers and the mailing list are to allow the participants to : - sort out as many as possible things before the workshop - help focusing the workshop discussion on the hardest and most controversial issues - raise objections and bring up controversial claims early on in order to prepare well thought of answers and constructive critique participants : a limited number , 30 or so , active participants will be selected on the basis of submitted papers . a small number , 5 or so , of no-paper - attendance-only participants will also be considered ; such persons should submit a one page research summary and a list of relevant publications . attendees are required to register for the main ijcai-95 conference . schedule / deadlines : very soon mosaic home page for the workshop set 3 . 15 . 95 papers received 4 . 03 . 95 selected papers accepted participants chosen 4 . 05 . 95 acceptance notifications sent to authors sent to ijcai selected papers to be included in the working notes list of confirmed participants request for equipment / room 4 . 15 . 95 mosaic home page for the workshop updated e-mail discussion begins 5 . 01 . 95 distributed to the participants final list of specific issues to be discussed at the workshop references to the existing work on context examples and data illustrating various aspects of context 7 . 15 . 95 final list of participants sent to ijcai 8 . 19 . 95 workshop takes place 12 . 01 . 95 written review of the workshop ready paper format : same as ijcai-95 : 12 pt article latex style 15 pages maximum , including title , abstract , figures , and references the first page must include : title author 's name ( s ) affiliation complete mailing address e-mail address phone / fax number ( s ) abstract of 200 or so words keywords submissions : electronic submissions are strongly preferred : direct : anonymous ftp to ftp . cs . wayne . edu ~ pub / context directory place the postscript or ascii version of your paper , your author + title + abstract ascii file , your references ( bibtex format preferred ) file , and a file with sample data and / or specific examples please , name your files with the name of the first author . for example , john block might place there the following : block . ps a . ps version of his paper block . text an ascii version of his paper if . ps not possible block-a . text an ascii file with authors names , title , and abstract block-r . bbl a bibliography file with references block-e . text an ascii file with sample data and / or specific examples email : lucja @ cs . wayne . edu as the last resort , four hard copies of the paper can be snail mailed to lucja iwanska department of computer science wayne state university detroit , mi 48202 , usa ( 313 ) 577-1667 ( phone ) ( 313 ) 577-2478 ( secretary ) ( 313 ) 577-6868 ( fax ) info about the workshop and the abstracts of the accepted papers is available via a mosaic home page at http : / / www . cs . wayne . edu / context primary contact : should you have any questions or need additional information , please contact lucja iwanska department of computer science wayne state university detroit , mi 48202 lucja @ cs . wayne . edu ( 313 ) 577-1667 ( phone ) ( 313 ) 577-2478 ( secretary ) ( 313 ) 577-6868 ( fax ) program committee : harry c . bunt , kub -

Forwarded-by: FlowerDid you know that you can tell from the skin whether a person is
sexually active or not?1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when woman
   make love they produce more of the hormone estrogen, which makes
   hair shiny and skin smooth.2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering
   dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses
   the pores and makes your skin glow.3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that
   romantic dinner.4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches
   and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable
   than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers!5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases the body
   endorphin into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and
   leaving you with a feeling of well-being.6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually
   active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called
   pheromones.  These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE
   EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages
   saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid
   that causes decay, preventing plaque build-up.9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release
   the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain.10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a national
    antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.ENJOY SEX!

they captured it! China is now set to conquer another major commodity, and
you can profit right along with them. This is just one example of how CMNW 
may make company history.Opening China's DoorUsing hard-won experience gained in the survivor-takes-all US Internet market, 
CMNW developed technology that makes it possible for China's millions of 
entrepreneurs, small and medium sized companies, and major corporations to 
do business worldwide via the Internet. Chinese makers of porcelain, for 
example, can deal direct with US consumers and retailers. Say ""goodbye"" to 
the layers of middlemen.CMNW strives to become a World Wide Wholesaler CMNW is attempting to become an International wholesaler to the world. This
is an enormous goal. Many believe that trade with China built the world's greatest
fortunes, from the golden age of Venice to the British Empire. Now this potential
is being transferred to the Internet, and CMNW will attempt to capture it.CMNW puts all this into your portfolio: stability of a US-based company... 
sky-rocketing China market...convenience of a US-listed stock...dynamics of 
a growth company. *** For the latest quarterly report on CMNW, go to www.freeedgar.com *** Obviously, you cannot go back in time to the year 1901 and invest in baby US 
companies like Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson as they were getting started. 
But you can grab the modern day equivalent. That's right. The growth 
potential in China at this very minute is like the United States at the start 
of the 20th century -- perhaps even greater. There's much more to the CMNW story. Including a major expansion into Mexico. To SUBSCRIBE to the future communications, please click on this link and hit send:

No that is appropriate content for the file.  I'm not a C programmer,
but I think that these sort of things (#include ) are
instructions to the compiler processed by a pre-processor in the compile
process, and include all sorts of symbols/functions
e.g. ""#include "" gives you maths type functions.  Since they
start with ""#"" they are ignored in the final compilation.Regarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel
software to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. 
I recall from your previous mail that there was a flag
    --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4
which could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate
directory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).  This might allow you to
persuade the code to compile against the correct headers.  I think this
is the right way to proceed.Alternatively, maybe the steps above regarding ""make dep"" and so forth
should have been performed in the directory where the make process is
looking for modversions.h & Co.I don't think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as
you describe below.  First of all you will move modversions.h (which you
have done), then you would have to move all those *.ver files, after
that, there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h)
files.  This could be quickly done, but is probably bad (those files
don't really belong there).For what it's worth I think you are very close to a successful
compilation.m>

"feminine-he , singular-they content - length : 8133 dear language scholars . i am presenting the following material as a discussion item . one of my ultimate purposes is to contribute to the revised oed due out in 2005 . for a paper i am currently working on , i ' m requesting comments and contributions . a summary will be forthcoming . feminine-he and singular-they mine is a new set of explanations for the two most regularly discussed grammatical oddities of english : indefinite / proverbial he and singular they . ( i will also touch on them and their . ) the orthodox view of pronoun history ( for she , they , them , their ) involves the north-to - south "" wave theory , "" as stated as early as 1866 by richard morris . it is the theory that is set forth in the oed and has never been questioned . the feminine h - stem , according to this accepted view , was displaced in the language in a wave of cultural diffusion when the feminine pronunciation began to approximate that of the masculine pronoun in the 12th and 13th centuries . the other pronouns discussed here also involved the north-to - south waves of diffusion . my contention is that the significant cause for the historical replacement of these pronouns ( except for the h - stem subject plural ) was the standardizing force exerted by the printing press - - it happened rather quickly - - not waves of cultural diffusion over centuries . in my analysis of the seventeen manuscripts of the a - version of piers plowman , the h - stem feminine is found with great regularity . how can this be explained ? in many lines , the occurrences in the manuscripts of h - stem feminines outnumber the sh - forms found in the same lines . many manuscripts use both forms . the manuscripts are copies of copies of copies . on the bases of the manuscripts that have been dated , i place the "" average "" manuscript within a few generations of the advent of printing . my explanation , perhaps the anglo - norman rulers had a predilection for a distinction in the masculine / feminine singular . while the folk generally used the bi-gendric "" egalitatian "" h - stem form in the vernacular , the more politically correct sh - form was preferred at oxford / cambridge , in proper social etiquette , and in writing when referring to a "" lady . "" when caxton began his enterprise , the sh - form ( as well as the others spoken of here ) became enforced as the correct form through the great power of the press . and the h - stem feminine remained known in the spoken language , alongside the sh - form , well beyond printing . it had not dropped from speech and become archaic by 1300 . when the "" prescriptive "" grammarians prescribed indefinite-he , this h - stem still carried in its semantic domain a bi-gendric reference . although the seventeen manuscripts of piers is my main corpus of evidence , there are various kinds of other evidence to support my theory for the late survival of the h - stem feminine in the colloquial of the middle ages . one of the more interesting is the existence of the h - stem feminine in gullah ( when and if west african origins are discounted ) . other supporting evidence can be found in various places in the oed . it is scanty and scattered , but nonetheless there . h - stem and sh - form feminines existed for centuries , side by side , as formal and informal , although , for sure , in many cases the distinction was lost . "" hi was a fair wifman "" is found in the mid - 14th century agenbite of inwyt ( i am currently translating this work ) . in it , the pronunciation of the feminine pronoun is the same as the modern masculine ! ( the vowel had not yet diphthongized ) . the supposition that this h - stem is a "" literary form , "" as suggested by the oed ( presumably this means copied in manuscript from an earlier exemplar ) is untenable because the agenbite was translated directly from french . i have extracted the pronoun paradigms from all the manuscripts of the a - version of piers . in addition to the great evidence for the wide use of the h - stem feminine centuries beyond its supposed demise , the h - stem plural ( although extremely rare ) can also be found ( in line prologue 63 it is used to satisfy alliteration ! ) . and in every manuscript of piers the h - stem obliques ( modern them and their ) are to be found ( often alongside the th - forms ) . and then , in a generation after printing , the h - stems for she , they , them , and their seem to vanish ! ! , at least from the written evidence . the h - stem feminine held wide currency in the colloquial of the middle ages and therefore , supported by other evidence , was not unknown to the prescriptive grammarians a few centuries later . the accepted theory that the h - stem feminine dropped from the language before 1300 , prior to the time the poem "" alysoun "" was written , is in need of revision . piers shows it to have been very much alive in the 15th century . an explanation for the replacement of the h - stem plural nominative by they , a replacement occurring earlier than the other pronouns in question , has never been proposed . would n't there have been pressure for some alternative to the oe h - stem subject plural as a result of the disappearance of the preterit plural during this period ? because the english verb lost its marker in the preterit for number , the h - stem plural ( which shared the same form with the feminine singular nominative ) became in some contexts ambiguous for number . a new form was needed . although a norse form may have reinforced it among northern speakers , there was a native singular form available from the same set of oe demonstratives that gave us the . the and they appear to be duplets . if this is so , then the singular morphology of they is in fact historical and has been alive in the colloquial for a very long time ! ! the , in oe a singular , developed as a singular / plural ( the car / cars ) , extended to the accusative , but lost its absolute ( stand-alone ) use . they , retaining the pronunciation of oe the , was restricted to the nominative , and became the unambiguous written plural by 1400 - - but in the colloquial it retained also its singular morphology . later , in regard to them and their , caxton used the th - forms as the unambiguous plurals because the h - stems for these pronouns had throughout england a tremendous diversity of forms . for example , in one ( written ) dialect her would be a feminine / singular / possesive , in another it would be an all-genders / plural / possesive . caxton needed forms that would be universally understood , hence the written th - form obliques replaced the h - stems in an historic blink of the eye - - not in a wave of cultural diffusion that coincidentally wafted through london at the time caxton set up his print shop . a well supported case can be made for the late survival of the h - stem feminine , into the 15th century , and hence a case for its cultural currency at the time of the prescriptive grammarians . if this is so , the exclusion of one gender from "" cognitive space "" would not apply , and hence the motives of these grammarians would have to be reassessed . if in fact the sapir - whorf hypothesis does apply to pronouns , then i invite comment to help me understand two facts . 1 ) that for two-thirds of the history of english the subject pronoun used to refer to a group of men / boys was a form that was identical to the feminine singular ; and 2 ) the expression by a pronoun of "" possessing "" something by men / boys was also for two-thirds of the history of english expressed by a form that was morphologically marked for feminine but not masculine .",0,Safe,zefang_phishing_email_dataset,0,email,True

"200 summary on reduplication a month before christmas ( in linguist vol-5 - 1354 ) i sent out a query about * reduplication * and how this strategy is grammaticalized in languages to convey some facet of * intensification * . this is a summary based on the 45 replies i received from linguist netters . allow me to thank you all collectively now , since i will not be referring to single respondents in the following discussion . the topic of reduplication interests me because i am writing on my phd on repetition with respect to intensification and iconicity in swedish . the point of departure in the original query were the claims found in lakoff & johnson ( metaphors we live by ; 1980 ) according to which reduplication may indicate : - plural or collective - intensification or increase - continuation or completion - diminution thus , ' more ' of physical linguistic ' form ' corresponds to ' more ' in the ' content ' of the reduplicated expression as opposed to a non-reduplicated form - - as an instance of diagrammatic iconicity ( or as a realization of the * conduit * metaphor in the terms of lakoff & johnson ) . there are reflections of the outlined principles in colloquial english in expressions like ' an old old man ' , ' the music got louder and louder ' , 's he talks talks talks ' , ' the ball bounced and bounced ' , ' there 's forms forms forms forms ' , ' it was sinking down down ' , etc . i originally mentioned , however , that these structures were * marked * in a language like english . the choice of words was perhaps not so lucky . what i meant by "" marked "" is that even if we may think that such expressions are frequent in casual speech , they are rare in more constrained contexts . a less marked way of intensifying would probably be to use a specific intensifier or quantifier , e . g . ' a very old man ' , ' talks a lot ' . i hope no one will be offended by this simplistic analysis , it is only leading us a bit beside the point . ( for a comprehensive account on "" repetition in english "" , see persson 1974 , univ . of uppsala , sw . ) i was in my query more after pointers to and examples of languages where reduplication as a means of * intensification * is an integrated , so to speak , a standard characteristic of the grammar . this was also , more or less , what i got . i will summarize the outcome in the following ; i am aware of that in most instances the "" facts "" are probably subject to qualification , but for the sake of clarity & brevity i will lay the examples ahead in a rather list-like manner . furthermore , the examples certainly represent only a sample of the languages in the world that have incorporated reduplication in their system . note that i have left out - - in order to make it all more illustrative - - possible tone marks and diacritics of the transliteration . 1 . plural or collective * in malay / bahasa ( indonesia ) , full word reduplication turns singular to plural : anak ' child ' anak-anak ' children ' * in nahuatl ( or "" aztec "" ) , prefixed reduplication with nouns conveys a plural meaning : cih-tli ' hare ' ( where ' cih - ' is the stem ) ci : cih-tli pl . - - moreover , there are no structurally distinct adjectives in nahuatl but certain "" adjectival "" suffixes that can take on a plural notion via reduplication : - pi : l diminutive suffix - pipi : l plural * hausa is cited to have reduplication in the formation of plurals of a limited set of nouns . * in japanese , reduplication may turn a noun to a collective , but the scope of this strategy is said to be marginal : hito ' person ' hitobito ' people ' kami ' god ' kamigami ' gods ' * in mandarin ( chinese ) , reduplication turns singular to collective ( but this is said to be rare ) : ren ' person ' renren ' people ' - - moreover , both in mandarin and cantonese * classifier * items may be reduplicated to convey "" universal quantification "" in contrast to more unique reference . this fits readily in the notion of intensification ( or augmentation ) : ge ren ' a person ' ( mandarin ) ge ge ren ' every person ' douh ' place , there ' ( cantonese ) douh-douh ' everywhere ' * dakotan patterns plurals of stative intransitive verbs with reduplication . this is said only to apply to instances with inanimate subjects though . north american languages in general may be of interest when considering reduplication but i am short of examples at present . following languages were mentioned in the replies , though : klamath , nez perce , sahaptin . 2 . intensification or increase * mandarin chinese intensifies adjectives with reduplication : xiao 's mall ' xiaoxiao ' very small ' gaoxing ' happy ' gaogaoxingxing ' very happy ' as you notice , with disyllabic adjectives the reduplication pattern is aabb . - - cantonese also uses reduplication for augmentation or emphasis . * turkish is , apparently , a point in case . reduplication of adjectives indicates intensification or increase in the following way : temiz ' clean ' tertemiz ' very clean ' dolu ' full ' dopdolu ' very full ' bos ' empty ' bosbos ' completely empty ' here we have prefixed reduplication accompanied with a binding consonant . interestingly , there do not seem to be "" rules "" for which binding consonant should be inserted in a given case . * hausa is cited to use reduplication in the intensification of adjectives . * celtic languages have full word reduplication to indicate intensification . the method is reminiscent of the case of english , but it may be more "" integrated "" in the grammar of the celtic ( are there any opinions about this ? ) . could the celtic model have influenced germanic languages so that we still today have rather similar reduplication in the colloquial registers ( just my own modest idea . . . ) ? here are some examples provided by netters : - - welsh : ty bach bach ' a very small house ' oglau cryf cryf ' a very strong smell ' - - gaelic : fada fada ' very long ' trua trua ' very pity ' - - breton : braz-braz ' very tall ' this is said to be common especially in negative sentences . * in colloquial russian reduplication / repetition of adj 's / adv 's has likewise an intensifying function . the use is probably stylistically similar to repetition in colloquial english , but it is said to be limited to * predicate * adjectives : belyj-belyj ' very white ' tixo-tixo ' very quietly ' * it was also pointed that finnish has prefixed reduplication in some intensified adjectival forms . this is true , indeed , but - - what it seems - - wholly lexicalized and non-productive . in any case , here are some examples i and my colleague enjoyed coming up with : taysi ' full ' ( umlaut a ) tapo-taysi ' completely full ' ( uml . a 's & o ) tyhja ' empty ' ( uml . a ) typo-tyhja ' compl . empty ' ( uml . a 's & o ) puhdas ' clean ' puti-puhdas ' compl . clean ' uusi ' new ' upo-uusi ' brand new ' pinta 's urface ' piri-pinta ' right on the surface ' suomalainen ' finnish ' supi-suomalainen ' purely finnish ' yksin ' alone ' ypo-yksin ' compl . alone ' ( uml . o ) tiessaan ' lost ' ( uml . a 's ) tipo-tiessaan ' compl . lost ' ( uml . a 's & o ) the prefixed items ' tapo ' , ' typo ' , ' tipo ' , 's upi ' , ' puti ' , ' piri ' , ' upo ' , ' ypo ' do not seem to mean anything , at least for the speakers today . it seems that the first vowel or the pair first consonant & vowel of the stem are reduplicated with a binding syllable that most often has a ' p ' and a vowel , e . g . : ta-po - taysi , ty-po - tyhja , u-po - uusi , y-po - yksin could this have been productive in some earlier stage of the language ? * finally , in classical ( only ? ) greek a small number of * verbs * may have reduplication to communicate some sort of intensifying , expressive or affective notions : pam-phain - ei ' it shines brightly ' ( ( * phan-phan - j-ei ) 3 . continuation or completion reduplication is , evidently , often used in the formation of present , progressive or perfective . i take here the view that present or progressive forms combine with * continuation * , whereas perfective forms communicate * completion * . it was nice to discover that "" classical "" linguistic tradition can offer fitting data here . it feels appropriate to begin with these examples . - - - * in sanskrit , the perfect stem is formed by reduplication : budh - ' know ' bubodh - perf . jan - ' born ' jajan - perf . aorist ( ' true perfect ' ) roots may also be formed by a kind of reduplication : jan - ajijana - ( aor . ) in addition , present stems may be formed by reduplication : bhii - 'd rink ' bibhii - pres . * classical greek uses partial reduplication , i . e . prefixation of the initial consonant of a verb plus the vowel ' e ' , in stems for perfect tenses : le-lu - k-a ' i have freed ' pe-poie : - k-a ' i have made ' ge-grap - tai ' it has been written ' if the root begins with a vowel , the vowel is augmented . furthermore , some common verbs take reduplication in their * present * tense ; the initial consonant is reduplicated with the vowel ' i ' : di-do : - mi ' i give / am giving ' gi-gno - mai ' i am becoming ' ti-the : - mi ' i am placing ' ( ( * thi-the : - mi ) * in latin , perfect forms may involve reduplication : curro ' run ' cucurri perf . - - - let us then go over to more living languages . * in hausa , reduplication applied to verbs in two different ways expresses completion or continuity respectively . modified suffixed reduplication gives an idea of * completed * action : cika ' fill ' cikakke compl . jefa ' throw ' jefaffe compl . prefixed reduplication communicates "" something like continuity "" , as expressed by the respondent : buga ' beat ' bubbuga ' keep on beating ' kira ' call ' kikkira ' call various people ' * in tagalog ( philippines ) , reduplication distinguishes * imperfective * actions from perfective : bili root of ' buy ' bibili irrealis imperfective upo root of 's it ' uupo irr . imp . kuha root of ' get ' kukuha irr . imp . some scholars call irrealis perfective * completed * aspect and irrealis imperfective * contemplated * aspect . this makes sense , since irrealis imperfective ' bibili ' seems to translate to ' will buy ' . * in wailevu / fijian ( austronesia ) , reduplication is used in so called "" object defocusing "" that involves repetition of the action and a progressive marker : au xau-ta na agone ' i carry the child ' au xau-xau jixo ' i ' m carrying now ' au dola-va na xaatuba ' i open the window ' au dola-dola jixo ' i ' m opening now ' moreover , in this language adjectives may be derived from verbs through reduplication . even if noted to be "" not productive "" , the process is fascinating : sava-ta ' wash - tr ' sava-sava - a ' clean ' the adjective could be understood to represent * completed * action , the result , in a way very similar to how the perfect participle works in , say , germanic : she has washed the cloth . - - ) a washed cloth * in nahuatl ( "" aztec "" ) , reduplication may affect the meaning of a verb in several ways . - - an action carried out in a "" systematic "" ( progressive ? ) way : tequi base for ' to slice ' or ' to hack ' te : tequi 's lice / carve something ' cho : ca ' weep ' cho : cho : ca ' weep continuously ' - - of the same base verbs , an action carried out in a "" random "" ( involving repetition ? ) way : tehtequi ' hack something up ' chohcho : ca ' to sob ' - - furthermore , reduplication may be recursive ( e . g . of ' weep continuously ' & 's ob ' respectively ) : cho : cho : cho : ca chohchohcho : ca - - verbs with certain morphologic characteristic may take on reduplication to indicate * repeated action * : tzili : ni ' make a metallic sound ' tzttzilica ' jingle ' tzitzilitza ' make something jingle ' * in afrikaans , reduplication applied to some verbs seems give a progressive idea : hy loop eet-eet ' he eats continuously while walking ' 4 . diminution there are not many examples of * diminution * in the total of replies . in a sense , the process of "" making something smaller "" could possibly go under the more general strategy of * intensification or increase * ( although it is literally about "" decrease "" ) . nevertheless , there were a couple of possibly fitting cases : * cantonese may use reduplication to convey * diminution * or * moderation * . * it was pointed that english ( ! ) has some "" diminutive "" reduplication in formations like ' itsy-bitsy ' , ' eensie - weensie ' , ' teeny-tiny ' . these carry the content ' very small ' , but they belong merely to the child-speak register . in any case , the examples are diagnostic of the diminutive case . 5 . other there are uses of reduplication that go beyond the suggested four categories above . with some restraint , some of these could perhaps be seen as slight offsprings of the more general principle of marking * plurality * . i do not go into detailed examples but mention some most common semantic categories : - - distributive reduplication : presupposes two or more referents that are taken separately ( type : ' one by one ' ) - - reflexive notions go naturally hand in hand with distributive ( type : ' one another ' ) - - the so called * delimitative aspect * , i . e . 'd oing something for a while ' , in mandarin and cantonese does not at first seem to fit in * continuity * or * completion * . however , the semantics of the delimitative aspect is said to encompass "" implied repetition "" : tai-tai ' take a look at ' ( cant . ) chang-chang ' have a taste ' ( man . ) shi-shi ' have a go ' ( man . ) what would seem logical to me is that a casual , temporally short action like ' take a look ' reaches its termination quicker than standard ' looking ' . i do n't know if this kind of an implicit sense of "" rapid completion "" could be the motivation of this reduplication ? - - - then there are numerous instances of reduplication that communicate * contrastive emphasis * . these do not necessarily combine with the above functional categories at all . the motivation of such reduplication is merely to * make a point * clearer . the ( american ) english "" double "" is a seemingly nice example of this : shall we rent a car car , or would you rather have a jeep ? of course , emphasis is a sort of * intensification * and , thus , it touches the theme of our discussion . * * * * now i think it 's time to close this rather lengthy summary . thanks for reading it . if you would like to add something to the discussion - - like comment on my suggestions - - , feel free to e-mail ( or snailmail ) the "" stuff "" directly to me .

20020722 Lockergnome Windows Daily
Â  07.22.2002 GnomeREPORT Hackers and crackers respect only one thing: strong security.  Keep the bad guys out of your PC or network with the advanced technology that's trusted by millions:  ZoneAlarm Pro 3.0. This best-in-class personal firewall stops hackers cold, defends your online privacy,and sets up in minutes. Click here to download now!   Listen to Lockergnomie Dale Lowery and you'll save time
immediately. It's an old tip, but it bears repeating: ""I'll often
find Web snippets I'd like to keep - but I don't want to save the
entire page. So, I've HOT-KEYED Notepad. Easy! Get to the most
common Notepad shortcut icon: Start | Programs | Accessories |
Notepad. Then right-click on the menu item and select Properties.
You'll see that this is (indeed) a shortcut; in the lower part of
the dialog is a field to add a hotkey. I entered 'N' for Notepad,
Windows offered CTRL and ALT as a prefix, and now I can launch
Notepad in an instant. I highlight the text I want to keep, copy
it, tap my shortcut, paste it, and then save the new text file
wherever I want. Most often, I use this trick to copy paragraphs
that describe downloads (and save them as text files in the same
folder as the download)."" Just make sure you don't pick a keyboard
shortcut that's already in use. Otherwise, one of them is gonna
get cranky.And while we're taking a trip down memory lane, Lockergnomie Ian
Rich reminds us of Jouni Vuorio's utility: The site is
jv16.org. The program is called
jv16 Power Tools, and this freeware is truly worthy of praise. It
combines a full-on registry management tool with several file
manager tools: one to hunt down temporary files in any format and
the other to help perform advanced file searches and comparisons.
Mainly, I wanted the program to be brought to the attention of the
consumer public, as it moves further and further along in
development it just keeps getting better. I've used it on windows
Me, and now XP - without crashes or hair-raising Registry
corruption. It backs up everything it changes and is very easy to
use. If you're interested in something of shareware-quality with
forum support (for absolutely nothing), get this program. Anyway,
I love the newsletter and the work you guys and gals do at
Lockergnome. I hope that this author gets his recognition.""
Consider this a huge nod!I love a good resource, and Lockergnomie Elton Jonsson from the
United Kingdom has one for us, too: ""As a dedicated subscriber, I
just had to tell about this one. Have you ever been driven mad
trying to find out the name of the piece of music on a television
advert? Well, at last, here in the UK, we have an answer to that
problem and, given that many multinationals use the same
advertising in the USA as they do here, it may help out you guys
as well. Check out Commercial
Breaks and Beats. I have no connection with it; I'm just
grateful that someone has had the brilliant idea of creating it.
If you check the message board on the site, you'll see that I'm
not alone."" This Google
Directory can help fill in the blanks, I'm sure. I
almost fell out of my chair the other day when I heard ""Yeh Yeh""
(by TMBG) being played on a Chrysler advertisement. Way to go:
John, John, Dan, Dan, and Dan! You're the dogs kids love to bite.And what's say we round out the report with another tip?
Lockergnomie David Brown can oblige: ""The e-mail forwarding
service is a good idea, but you can do it yourself with Outlook
Express. Set up two accounts (one for your old account and one for
your new one). Craft your reply in a new message and save it.
Then, select Tools | Message Rules | Mail | New rule. Check 'Where
the message is from specified account' in the first section.
'Reply with message"" in section two. Select the appropriate
account and message in the final section. Name it. You can also
have the messages flagged or moved to another folder if you want
to know which messages came from the old account. Once the rule
has been created, any mail from the old account will have a reply
sent. People should learn about mail rules, anyway."" True! So,
what rule simplifies your day?See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Chris PirilloÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â

I'm not good with calendar dates; truth be told, I don't even know what day of the week it is most the time. If I didn't have my PDA armed with a Calendar with me, then I wouldn't show up to anything on time, let alone on the right day. Well, that is great for when I am mobile, but what about when I am in front of my PC? The PDA is docked, but that doesn't mean I have to be without a calendar... enter QuicKalendar! ""QuicKalendar gives you quick and easy access to a calendar whenever you need it. You can view the calendar on screen, or print it out to jot down notes and appointments."" You need to keep in mind that the print feature is relative to how you have QuicKalendar displayed on your machine. If you are in full screen mode, then the printout will be bigger than a standard sheet of letter paper. If you try printing in normal view, then the printout will be too small to write on. My suggestion is to play with the size of QuicKalendar's screen until you get a printout that you can be proud of. Now, you'll have no reason to be late for Gnomedex!
Diatris v1.0 [407k] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://www.webruler.com/mtreciokas/{Tetris-like game} I've always been fascinated with geometric shapes. To me everything has to be somewhat symmetrical... even my hair! So it was no wonder why I was addicted to playing the game Tetris for so many years. The only problem with Tetris is that, after awhile, it starts to get a little too easy. Diatris is a bundle of three different - and much more challenging - Tetris-like games. ""For the first game, Y-Diatris, the objects can move vertically and diagonally. The second game, X-Diatris, the objects can move only in two diagonal directions; the vertical drop is taken out. For the last game H-Diatris the objects can only move vertically and horizontally like most block drop games."" I won't kid you, these games can be pretty hard, but if you are a Tetris fan, then these set of games are for you. If you're not a Tetris fan, don't worry, there are a few other games you might like on this site, so check it out!

How to Troubleshoot Issues with Reading CDshttp://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q321641{Disc device troubleshooting} ""This article describes how you can troubleshoot issues reading CD-ROM or DVD-ROM optical discs. This article also discusses how to troubleshoot common issues with CD-R and CD-RW devices. The steps in this article apply to compact disc (CD-ROM) drives, compact disc recordable (CD-R) drives, compact disc re-writable (CD-RW) drives, and digital video disc (DVD) drives."" To summarize, you should try the steps on this site before calling your technical support. Some of the steps include closing unnecessary software, testing the disc in a different computer, and cleaning the disc. Make sure to clean a disc by wiping from the center of the disc outward... if you wipe the disc in a circular fashion, then you risk scratching it. The steps in this article will only serve to save you time, as you will probably be able to fix most disc problems by following the steps. If this article doesn't help you resolve your disc problem, look on the bright side... you won't have to spend so much time on the phone with technical support, because you'll already know what the problem ISN'T!

Modem Spy v3.1.3b [230k] W9x/2k/XP $25
    Unearthed by Sergei Polishchukhttp://www.modemspy.com/{Answering machine} ""Modem spy is a handy utility for phone calls recording. Features: 1) Records phone conversations. 2) Records from microphone. 3) Plays back recorded messages via phone line. 4) Plays back recorded messages via sound card. 5) Can record ALL incoming phone calls. 6) Has built-in software automatic gain control. 7) Detects and logs Caller ID."" Gnomie Brian Stevens tried this one out for us, but had a small problem testing this on any of his machines... he doesn't have any modems! Brian says, ""I was able to load the program, though, and try a few of the features out. You can record an audio memo to your machine, much like an answering machine. You can also e-mail this audio memo, although I don't recommend you do that as the WAV file didn't seem to play well when I tried e-mailing it to myself (which may have been due to the microphone it was recorded with). Other than that, Modem Spy is a solid program and is a great alternative to buying a traditional answering machine... plus in most cases it is cheaper!"" Keep in mind that, for Caller ID to work, you need the Caller ID service turned on by your phone service provider.

TheAvocadoPapers.com is one of those sites that is a little bit goofy but extremely creative. It isn't that the Web site is really about anything; there is some creative writing (usually rather funny) and the occasional interview (this week ""Steve Schneider Interviews Himself""). If you are a little bit nosy, and want to peek into the lives of others, you can read Ron Bork's diary or enter the Avocado Chat. Although the makers of the Web site don't even know what it is about, I think it is quite apparent... fun! Go check out the Web site for yourself and see if you can pin down its rhyme or reason.

Â GnomeTIPThis tip is for the Windows XP users out there. ""The Windows XP operating system achieves excellent performance in part by dynamic adjustments that it makes in response to how a system is utilized. In particular, many adjustments are made when the system first runs following setup and when newly installed applications are used for the first time. These adjustments greatly influence the performance of the system. Unfortunately, the dynamic nature of Windows XP can make benchmarking more of a challenge than with previous Windows versions."" To properly benchmark your Windows XP system, there are a few steps you should follow. The step with which we are concerned in this particular tip is letting your PC process any ""idle tasks."" Idle tasks are tasks that your PC executes when it deems the system to be unused or idle. Some of these include file placement optimization, system restore, and done-once-after-setup work items. ""All of these 'idle tasks' are controllable by a system API in advapi32.dll, ProcessIdleTasks. The API's sole purpose is to allow benchmarks a simple way to force any pending idle tasks to be executed immediately, without having to wait a lengthy period of time. To call ProcessIdleTasks from the command line, use this syntax: Rundll32.exe advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks."" Once running, it may take up to around 15 minutes to process all of the idle tasks, and your hard drive will be active through most of it. For more steps on preparing your Windows XP machine for benchmarking, head over to the Windows Platform Development page on Benchmarking for Windows XP on Microsoft's site.

"Friends & Future Millionaire: AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home for an investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars expense one time THANK'S TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! ================================================== BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so gladI finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $ 610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."" Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. =================================================== Here is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.'' More testimonials later but first, ===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTUREREFERENCE ====== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. === When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happen to your computer. IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! ========================================================== **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ========================================================== Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2 . Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4 ... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGUREOUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! ========================================================= REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ======================================================= Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and dd METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receivethe report. =========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address. PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : ==================================================== REPORT # 1: ""The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net"" Order Report #1 from: A. Christ 1208 Allendale Rd. Mechanicsburg, PA 17055___________________________________________________________ REPORT # 2: ""The Insider's Guide to Sending Bulk e-mail on the Net"" Order Report # 2 from: Michael P. 2508 Robin Altus, OK 73521 USA ____________________________________________________________ REPORT # 3: ""Secret to Multilevel Marketing on the Net"" Order Report # 3 from : D. J. 16 Northcrest Dr. London, ONTARIO, CANADA N5X 3V8 __________________________________________________________ REPORT # 4: ""How to Become a Millionaire Utilizing MLM & the Net"" Order Report # 4 from:E. Zurbrigg RR #1 St. Marys, ON, Canada N4X 1C4 ____________________________________________________________ REPORT #5: ""How to Send Out 0ne Million e-mails for Free"" Order Report # 5 from: A. Ebert R. R. #4 Thamesford, Ontario, Canada N0M 2M0____________________________________________________________ $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. === After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. === Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ====================================================== FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! ============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================ ""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jodyaboutreceiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spoutingmy knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''. Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ====================================================== ''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big."" Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ======================================================= ''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks."" Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. ======================================================= ''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet."". Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand ======================================================= ORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON 'YOUR' ROAD TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM ! ======================================================= If you have any questions of the legality of this program, contact the Office of Associate Director for Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Washington, D.C.

Tru64 and that took care of it.   When I did the ""make install"" I got this error:LOCK:  -f /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf
 || cp rules/local.cf /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf
sh: syntax error at line 1: `||' unexpected
*** Exit 2
Stop.   It appears that this comes from the ""inst_cfs:"" part of the Makefile,
which copies local.cf into /etc/mail/spamassassin.  The Makefile has
brackets around the -f test, but they don't show up above.  Any ideas?Jim

Date: Not suppliedI feel so tremendously validated right now in all my criticisms of Netscape vs. 
Mozilla. I told Netscape management that if the Netscape beta shipped without 
popup blocking that CNet would write an article on it. They didn't believe me 
(or didn't care). Sure enough, the article appeared right on time[1].I blogged about two main annoyances when installing Netscape 7: the lack of 
popup blocking and all of the annoying advertising spam on the desktop and in 
the toolbars. I warned Netscape that they needed to take steps to correct this 
problem. They didn't listen. Take a look at the CNet review[2] highlight that 
describes *The Bad* part of Netscape 7.0:_Displays AOL ads everywhere; doesn't let you turn off pop-up windows like 
Mozilla does; devours 30MB of disk space._Plenty of other engineers at Netscape (as well as managers) complained about 
these problems and fought with those higher up to correct these problems. We 
lost every battle. The simple truth is that the people in charge of running the 
Netscape browser are incompetent. They don't understand how to make a good 
browser, or they don't care. Their engineers tell them what they're doing 
wrong, and they don't listen. Maybe you'll listen to the public. How about eWeek's article, Netscape 7.0 
Shrivels Under Mozilla's Shadow[3]? Are you paying attention now, you ignorant, 
stupid, incompetent buffoons?""I told you so."" never felt so good.Maybe they will sit up and take notice now. If they do, well, it's about 
fucking time. And people wonder why I quit working for AOL.

Forwarded by: Gary Williams A Mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a 
short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex 
life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard 
from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding.  The 
card said nothing but ""Maxwell House"".  Mom was puzzled at first, but 
then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: ""Good till 
the last drop."" Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, 
and the card read: ""Benson & Hedges"".  Mom now knew to go straight to 
her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: 
""Extra Long, King Size"".  She was again slightly embarrassed but still 
happy for her daughter. The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for 
a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing.  Then after a 
whole month, a card finally arrived.  Written on it with shaky 
handwriting were the words: ""British Airways"".  Mom took out her latest 
Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, 
and finally found the ad for the airline.  The ad said: ""Three times a 
day, seven days a week, both ways."" Mom fainted.

"HelloYou may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""More testimonials later but first, =========== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ====
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!INSTRUCTIONS:=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 26.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then

"extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe - cera insight title : extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2184 overview : a comprehensive reform of gas legislation in central and eastern europe is bringing the region in line with the european union  , s gas directive . this is true both for the countries expected to enter the union by 2004  ) 05  * czech republic , estonia , hungary , poland , and slovenia - - and for candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the decade - - bulgaria , latvia , lithuania , romania , and slovakia . in cera  , s view current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for the internal gas market in eastern and central europe look promising from an investor  , s point of view . the candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the implementation of the eu gas directive during a two - day workshop held by the european commission and the world bank in paris in november . many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries throughout the 1990 s as part of their transition to a market economy . the results have been mixed , particularly in the utility industries . the 1998 gas directive ( adopted in august 2000 ) now offers a compelling incentive for eu candidate countries to transform their gas industries , while providing a road map to guide them . the critical points relevant to harmonization between the european union and candidate countries include the following : * legal framework and regulation . the legal framework is the cornerstone of enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in europe . as a result , in all candidate countries in 1999  ) 2000 energy laws were either updated or newly established along the principles spelled out in the gas directive . regulatory bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country , although issues of staffing , financial autonomy , and independence from political influence are not uniformly resolved . * third - party access ( tpa ) and long - term take - or - pay contracts . all candidate countries agree that tpa is a key to market competition . therefore , all have adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation . although the commission favors regulated tpa , the specific approaches to tpa enforcement in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases . in particular , the implementation of tpa will have to address the issue of long - term take - or - pay contracts with russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies and somewhat preempt competition . russian gas is for the most part sold to single , traditional state - owned operators that dominate their internal markets . a balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant players and the competitive environment . this is made more complicated by their ownership of large volumes of russian gas supplied in kind in exchange for transit rights to west european customers . article 25 of the directive provides for ! a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take - or - pay obligations . this derogation would apply to the companies of candidate countries with historical and commercial links with the russian gas industry . furthermore , article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only one major gas supplier , to those with an  +  + emerging gas market status ,  ,  , or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another member state . most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the european union . * price cross - subsidies . residential gas tariffs are artificially low and are financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers . in various countries , tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have been scheduled , but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce . this has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage of imported gas to oil prices . all candidate countries have set legal frameworks that include the phasing out of cross - subsidies as part of sector reform , but the actual implementation will remain politically difficult . as table 1 indicates , price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expected to enter the european union by mid - decade , but the legal framework itself cannot guarantee the pace of reform . the same goes for candidate countries that have only recently introduced eu - complying energy laws and whose entry to the european union is likely to happen in a longer time frame . * unbundling . most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of liberalization . to date , unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countries . in the future , the commission is likely to press all eu countries for legal separation (  & structural unbundling  8 ) of the businesses , and candidate countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly . table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries . as the table shows , the countries belonging to the second group have only very recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the directive , whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries scheduled for the first wave . * * end * * follow above url for full report . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 , 2001 !

"from http://www.arstechnica.com/""There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Department
of Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against
individuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted
material over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes
that ""criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to
preserve the viability of America's content industries."" Malcolm also
believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are
participating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download
copyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions
such as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see
businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of
copyrighted works.
""Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think
they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal
prosecution,"" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same
conference panel.I'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is
hoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or
warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor
deterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits
carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate
further animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to
initiate because of the ""schooling"" effect of millions of systems
participating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from
the crowd.The article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines
illegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:
Criminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for
purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the
reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any
180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more
copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....
For purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution
of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish
willful infringement.
...
The term ""financial gain"" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of
anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.
Therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as ""financial gain""
even if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the
value of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15
to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the
perspective of the consumer or copyright holder.The statute of limitations:
507. Limitations on actions(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained
under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five
years after the cause of action arose.(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the
provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after
the claim accrued.The penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in
Section 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time
criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.I'm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to
prosecute because of the aforementioned ""schooling"" effect, but my guess
would be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent
individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be
targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers. Thanks to
MonaLisaOverdrive for pointing out this story.

Things have got much better... You're right in that the JDK used to suck on Linux... But then, IMHO, Linux is still maturing.... or at least development tools for Linux are maturing... I've been developing a few server side apps that run on Linux recently with JDK 1.3.x and they've had no problems with great performance.Robert Harley worte: >Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows. >They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a >service pack. Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to >run C programs.Hmmm... Do you really think that MS is pulling out Java because it's a ""Bad"" programming language or application platform? You don't think this has anything to do with .NET being a competitor to Java do you? Or that MS has basically copied Java (with some additional features) and called it C#? Isn't that alone an indication that they actually DO think that a VM is the right way to go for most high level applications?Reza B'Far wrote: >2.

You're telling me that you've never had a nasty bug that took you a couple of days to track down that had to do with a memory leak? I am not the best C/C++ programmer... not even close... But I've known really good ones... and even they have nasty bugs that have to do with memory management, however occasional they may be.>It's about design patterns, architecture, high level stuff... Robert Harley wrote: >If your problem just requires application of a ""design pattern"" to solve, >then it's trivial anyway irrespective of language.Wow! So you're telling me that unless the application involves bit-counting, it's trivial? What about the application itself? What about high level problems such as task distribution, work-flow, etc.? Aren't most high level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns? Or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal C/C++ code? For example, do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworks (there are lots of them on this list), are working on writing an operating system with assembly that provides for a collaborative environment?>I am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low >level problems that have been solved 10 million times over and over >and over again... Robert Harley wrote: >You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time >on irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don't. Depends >entirely on the programmer, not the language.I can see how you could infer this. However, what I believe to really be the case is that Java is one of the best languages for writing large applications with many components that involves the collaboration of more than three programmers. In those cases, it's always very hard to get the programmers to agree on API's, memory management techniques, etc. With Java, the JCP takes care of the discussions so that you don't sit around in a long meeting trying to decide what API to use to hook up to a database (JDBC) or a messaging bus (JMS). >3.

Robert Harley wrote: >Unsupported assertion.So, are you saying that there is a standard set of API's for C/C++ for everything? (aside to the minimal ANSI stuff). Is there a standard way of dealing with C/C++ applications for various domain problems (messaging, database persistence, etc.) that rivals Java? I'd like to know if there is one accepted by everyone who writes C/C++... In that case, I claim ignorance...Not suggesting that Java is the golden hammer.... Just that C/C++ is overkill for most things... I even coded in VB... But VB is a true disgrace to programming... It's just lame... Java is Object Oriented... (no flame-mail from the anti-OO people please... that is a religious discussion...) and relatively clean... And I don't think that every ""Kid"" can write a well designed Java program. Kids typically don't understand various design patterns and principles... To my experience, they actually tend to think more of the low level problems, wanting to rewrite and reinvent the world... a tendency that is much more possible, IMHO, in C/C++ than in Java due to existence of standard API's.",0,Safe,zefang_phishing_email_dataset,0,email,True

"Kragen, This is an interesting analysis. I think that there are a couple of nits I might pick (for example, I don't expect that the market will be well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that the most important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fix their systems, is almost passed over. I know that you know this, and you allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others. There's one other point which you don't make, which I think is very important, which is that research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of available vulnerability code. I can think of three researchers into automated methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about the quality of the existing vulnerability sites. Doing research into a set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that you can define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test predictions. I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we wouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort. And the security admin's job would be a lot harder.Adam On Thu, Aug 22, 2002 at 08:42:12AM +0200, Eugen Leitl wrote: | -- | -- Eugen* Leitl leitl | ______________________________________________________________ | ICBMTO: N48 04'14.8'' E11 36'41.2'' http://eugen.leitl.org | 83E5CA02: EDE4 7193 0833 A96B 07A7 1A88 AA58 0E89 83E5 CA02 | | | ---------- Forwarded message ---------- | Date: Thu, 22 Aug 2002 00:24:54 -0400 (EDT) | From: Kragen Sitaker | To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org | Subject: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards | | On August 7th, an entity known as ""iDEFENSE"" sent out an announcement, | which is appended to this email. Briefly, ""iDEFENSE"", which bills | itself as ""a global security intelligence company"", is offering cash | for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software | that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell | anyone else. | | If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a | very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure. | | At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research | known as ""full disclosure""; people who discover security | vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short | while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem | --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the | vulnerability, if possible. | | This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by | CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call ""responsible | disclosure"" --- never release working exploit code, and never release | any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released | a patch. This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers | vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked | on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people | wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem | was. | | The underground computer criminal community would often discover and | exploit these same holes for months or years while the ""responsible | disclosure"" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the | underground, vulnerable. | | The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known | are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to | reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software, | turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and | detecting and responding to intrusions. They are therefore much less | useful to would-be intruders. Also, software companies usually see | security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so | prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as | long as possible. | | iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous | than either of the two previous paradigms. They want to be a buyer in | a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding | discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash. | | Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently | including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the | secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software | vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to | Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if | HP retained Snosoft's ""consulting services"". HP considered this | extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the | information. | | If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which, | together, add up to a catastrophe. | | First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to | the highest bidder, and to nobody else. For reasons explained later, | I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime | syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers. | | Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will | become lucrative for many more talented people. The result will be | --- just as in the ""responsible disclosure"" days --- that the good | guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority | of current vulnerabilities are kept secret. | | I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the | vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's | plausible. If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets | them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the | people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when | credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example. | Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site | administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some | negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars. | | I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability | information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to | execute the largest heists without getting caught. Inevitably, that | means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who | are good at networked theft may not yet exist. | | There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as | Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR | than a gang could make by theft. Think of a remote-root hole in | Samba, for example. | | Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either | motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public | interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or | personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits. Creating | a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly | increase the availability of that information to the people who can | afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime. | | Let's not let that happen. | | | | | This is the original iDEFENSE announcement: | | From: Sunil James [mailto:SJames@iDefense.com] | Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 12:32 PM | Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program | | | Greetings, | | iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability | Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance | notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code. | | iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following | provides answers to some basic questions about the program: | | Q. How will it work? | A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish | security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number | of motivations, including the following: | | * Pure love of security research | * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks | * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products | * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure | | The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the | Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the | work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following | items: | | * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit) | * The amount of detail and analysis provided | * The potential severity level for the information shared | * The types of applications, operating systems, and other | software and hardware potentially affected | * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs | * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE | | Q. Who should contribute to the VCP? | A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other | entity. | | Q. Why are you launching this program? | A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions | to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More | often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the | original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is | compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the | public at large are warned in a timely manner. | | Q. Who gets the credit? | A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or | exploit information. | | Q. When can I contribute? | The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today. | | To learn more, go to http://www.idefense.com/contributor.html. If you have | questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please | contact us at contributor@idefense.com. | | Regards, | | Sunil James | Technical Analyst | iDEFENSE | | ""iDEFENSE is a global security intelligence company that proactively | monitors sources throughout the world -- from technical vulnerabilities and | hacker profiling to the global spread of viruses and other malicious code. | The iALERT security intelligence service provides decision-makers, frontline | security professionals and network administrators with timely access to | actionable intelligence and decision support on cyber-related threats. | iDEFENSE Labs is the research wing that verifies vulnerabilities, examines | the behavior of exploits and other malicious code and discovers new | software/hardware weaknesses in a controlled lab environment."" | | http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork | -- ""It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once."" -Hume http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0,Safe,zefang_phishing_email_dataset,0,email,True

"bilingualism i ' m not sure why , but i was reluctant to post on the issue of us bilingualism . in any case , i feel obliged to say this as an educational linguist who has worked in esl and tangentially in bilingual ed teacher education . first of all , the entire notion that bilingual ed was , is , or could be ( designed as ) a method for introducing national plurilingualism is a nonstarter . therefore any debates about it using plurilingualism as argument get nowhere . in fact , with out a wish to flame anyone ( because i do n't think it was intentional ) the entire argument that we should stop bilingual ed because of its anti - english or anti-standard english agenda is of a kind very familiar to us in educational circles . it 's little different than what we hear from those who argue that proponents of progressive educational idea x ( e . g . whole langauge reading instruction , process writing , outcomes-based ed . ) are trying to bring down standards , undermine society , do something unamerican , and so on . it is essentially a rhetorical manipulation of the worst kind , based on false suppositions , and intended to push hot buttons . by saying this i am not defending bilingual ed or any other movement . however , i think these need to be debated on their educational merits . why is the argument a nonstarter ? admittedly , there are those in education who propose that students have the right to their own dialect language or what-have - you , and that they should n't have to learn standard english in school . however , they are largely involved in an academic exercise that takes place in the pages of journals of various sorts . they do not shape policy . the avowed purpose of the vast majority of bilingual ed programs is usually to ease a limited english proficient child into the mainstream . the idea is that if they take content area courses in their first language they will not fall behind while learning english . the programs contain esl components that supposedly will allow the kids to mainstream later . some programs do encourage native language literacy and continue classes native language classes throughout a child 's school career . some take very young english speaking kids and put them into these classes on an immersion basis . since usually older english speaking kids in other schools are trying , in theory , to learn the same language the immigrant kids are already fluent in , i fail to see what is controversial about that . it seems to be designed , in theory again , to encourage personal , not societal , bilingualism . the failings of bilingual ed , in places where it has failed , have more to do with poor educational practice than with policy . if kids are arriving at college after say five years in bilingual ed , and are entering esl programs , something did n't work right . to anyone remotely familiar with urban schools , that should hardly be a surprise . now , on a national level i think we should look at us bilingualism and forget about catalonia or the basque country for a moment . bilingualism in the us has endured over many generations in several situations : ( i ) tight - knit religious communities : hasidic jews who speak yiddish , old order amish , brethren , and mennonites , who speak their german dialects . ( ii ) groups who were overtaken , to put it nicely , by english speakers : the navajo and other indigenious peoples ; french creole speakers in louisiana , spanish in the southwest . ( iii ) isolated communities : gullah in south carolina and georgia . immigrants , it would seem , tend to assimilate linguistically over a few , typically very few generations . in spite of the myth that spanish - speakers are somehow different on this score , i think , it would be instructive to look at the case of new york , which is full of people young hispanics who cannot speak more than a few words of spanish - this in spite of continuing immigration from spanish - speaking countries . as a non - yiddish or hebrew speaking ashkanazi jew , i entirely understand this phenomenon although as a learner of spanish as a foreign language , i lament the lost opportunity . finally , i think it would be more instructive to look at which americans feel threatened by the non-existent threat of the demise of something that has never existed ( the us as a monolingual nation ) and try to figure out why people feel that way . why , for example , is it an issue in the west and not in new york ? why is it associated with right and not the left ? why has it come up now again ? is it it really just good old american nativism , ' 90s style , or is there something different going on ? also , why have n't we in linguistics and education done more to communicate with mainstream americans that the whole thing is a lot of nonsense ? michael newman dept . of educational theory & practice the ohio state university mnewman @ magnus . acs . ohio-state . edu",0,Safe,zefang_phishing_email_dataset,0,email,True

affected by gravity, resulting in
the potential energy for a mass M
to be linear in height h: Mgh.What relative concentrations will
we have when two different packets
of air are in equilibrium?If they are at the same height, we
will have half the mass in one, and
half the mass in the other, and the
amount flowing from one to the other
balances the amount flowing in the
opposite direction.[0]If they are at differing heights,
then a greater percentage of the
higher air tends to descend than
that percentage of the lower air
which ascends.  In order for the
two flows to balance, the higher
packet must contain less air than
the lower, and the mass balance
of the flows corresponds thusly:    high percentage of thin air
    ---------------------------
    low percentage of dense airNow, rates are exponential in
energy differences[1], so that
theoretically we should expect
an exponential decay in height,
to compensate.  How does it go
in practice?-Dave[0] How well does it balance?
    Chemical equilibria seem 
    stable, as they deal with
    very large numbers over a
    very long time.  Economic
    equilibria are viewed from
    the mayfly standpoint of
    individual people, and so,
    at best, the shot noise is
    very visible.[1] That is to say, rates will
    be exponential in the free
    energy differences between
    endpoints and a transition
    state.  We can ignore that
    complication in this model.

Let's see... a decimal digit is about 3.33 bits, so this is all about moving from a 36-bit to a 46-bit addressing system. Kind of makes the debate about IPv6 spaces quite real, as well as the Auto-ID center at MIT's proposal for a physical markup language. Actual barcode size may yet decline to the point that 2-D codes may yet make it an individual-item level of addressing.Seeing software systems this fantastically brittle after fifty years is not, unfortunately, surprising. Are we sure we really know better yet? Are angle brackets really the key to immortality? :->Interesting reinforcement of the Voyager piece I archived earlier today... RKkhare@alumni.caltech.edu
Bigger Bar Code Inches Up on RetailersAugust 12, 2002
By KATE MURPHY 
 In a little more than two years, retailers in the United
States and Canada will face a deadline that promises
technological challenges akin to the Year 2000 computer
problem. Starting Jan. 1, 2005, the 12-digit bar codes retailers use
to identify everything from cars to candy bars will go to
13 digits. The additional number (and associated bars and
spaces) is enough to make checkout scanners seize up and
make computers crash, perhaps disrupting entire supply
chains. But many retailers have yet to focus on a problem that will
require significant investments in time and capital. ""Most retailers are public companies that tend to live
quarterly and not look ahead, which means they are going to
be hit over the head with this and have to scramble at the
last minute to avert disaster,"" said Thomas Friedman,
president of Retail Systems Research Services, a company in
Newton, Mass., that publishes a retail information
technology newsletter. Leading retailers say they have begun to address the issue.
A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest
retailer, said the company had ""embraced the concept"" of an
expanded bar code, but he did not respond to questions
about actual measures taken to prepare computer databases
and logistical systems. Similarly, a spokesman for the
Target Corporation said his company was ""intellectually
ready"" for the change but refused to comment on whether any
of its stores or warehouses were technologically ready. But Richard A. Galanti, the chief financial officer of
Costco Wholesale, admitted, ""The truth is, given the
timeline, everybody's still in the assessment phase, trying
to figure out what to do."" The difficulty is similar to the one posed by the Year 2000
computer problem, when computer software had to be switched
from two-digit entries identifying years to four-digit
entries. Before Jan. 1, 2000, millions of lines of code had
to be rewritten to avoid widespread computer failures. Bar codes have been used in packaging since 1974, when the
first item, a pack of chewing gum, was scanned at a
supermarket in Ohio. The codes identify a product,
distinguishing between an eight-ounce can of Del Monte
creamed corn and a medium-size pair of Hanes boxer shorts.
When a bar code is scanned, the information in the store's
database lets the retailer assign a price and track sales
and inventory. ""The bar code is the linchpin upon which everything in
retail depends,"" Mr. Friedman said. The reason for expanding the 12-digit bar code, known as
the Universal Product Code, is twofold. First, there is a
shortage of U.P.C. numbers. ""There's only a certain amount
of 12-digit numbers, and we're going to run out,"" said John
Terwilliger, vice president of global markets at the
Universal Code Council, a nonprofit organization based in
Lawrenceville, N.J., that assigns codes in the United
States and Canada. Second, 13-digit bar codes are used
almost everywhere else in the world. The council's European
counterpart, EAN International, based in Brussels, assigns
these numbers, called European Article Numbers, to
companies in 99 nations. ""Right now,"" Mr. Terwilliger said,
""foreign importers have to get a 12-digit U.P.C. to do
business over here, which they haven't been too happy
about."" Foreign manufacturers currently pass on to consumers the
cost of getting an additional bar code and creating special
labels for products sold in the United States and Canada.
""It's an added expense for them, and they have to recoup it
somewhere,"" said Debra Shimkus, marketing manager at the
Chicago Importing Company, a specialty food importer whose
overseas suppliers are often incredulous when they are told
they have to get new bar codes for their products before
they can be sold in American groceries. Many foreign manufacturers decide that it is not worth the
trouble. ""A lot of companies have been unwilling to accept
the additional burden,"" Mr. Terwilliger said, ""and have
stayed out of the market entirely."" American and Canadian exporters have not had the same
obstacle because foreign retailers can easily incorporate a
12-digit number into their 13-digit databases by making the
first digit zero. That is why American and Canadian
manufacturers of products that now have 12-digit codes will
not be affected by the code expansion. A two-liter bottle
of Coca-Cola, for example, will keep the same U.P.C., but a
zero will be added to the beginning of its bar-code number
in retailers' product databases. ""The effect of the change in the U.P.C. code falls squarely
on retailers,"" said Mr. Friedman. He estimates that the
upgrade will cost at least $2 million for a chain of 100
stores with 10 checkout lanes a store. The expense will vary depending on the age of a retailer's
databases, software and hardware and whether it has to hire
outside consultants to make the change. Scanners and other
hardware bought more than three years ago will not read
longer codes and will have to be replaced. Software more
than five years old will also have to be scrapped. ""Thank God we'd already planned to buy new equipment for a
lot of stores this year,"" said Richard S. Gilbert, director
of store systems at Duane Reade, a chain of 200 drugstores
in New York City. The stores have a total of 3,500 scanning
devices, each costing $1,000 to $2,500. As for the
cumbersome database modifications that need to be made, Mr.
Gilbert said: ""Our consultants say they are working on it,
but they haven't gotten back to me with a plan. I still
don't know how big a deal it's all going to be."" He might want to ask John Poss. Mr. Poss is the
merchandising coordinator for Ace Hardware, which has 5,100
stores and sells some 65,000 coded products. Ace overhauled
its computer systems to accept longer bar codes in 1999.
The company, based in Oak Brook, Ill., has retail outlets
in 70 countries and more than a hundred foreign suppliers. ""It was such a struggle to get manufacturers to relabel
things for North America,"" Mr. Poss said, ""and we wanted
the same system in place globally, so we decided to make
the change."" The company hired a consultant, Cognizant Technology
Solutions, which is based in Teaneck, N.J., and is a
division of Dun & Bradstreet. Ace's in-house team worked on
the project during the day while a Cognizant office in
India took over at night. Even so, the project took almost two years to plan and
carry out. In addition to equipment upgrades, modifications
had to be made in more than 500 software programs in
various company divisions (50 in distribution alone). The
most tedious and time-consuming part of the conversion, Mr.
Poss said, was making adjustments to databases. ""Every
database in every division touches bar code information,
and they all needed to be reworked,"" he said. ""It's like
Y2K, where you had to go in and expand fields and find
every reference to the date."" Though Mr. Poss would not disclose the cost of the project,
he said the gains in efficiency and in suppliers' good will
had been ""well worth the expense."" His advice to other
retailers is to ""get busy because you're facing an extreme
challenge."" But moving to 13 digits may not be enough. The Universal
Code Council and EAN International, which formed an
alliance in 1996, strongly advise manufacturers and
retailers to go a step further and prepare their systems to
accommodate a 14-digit code. That is the length of a newly
patented bar code that takes up less space. Its reduced
size means that it can be affixed to small items like loose
produce, and the extra digits let a retailer keep track of
additional data like batch and lot numbers. That additional information would make product recalls
easier. ""Today,"" Mr. Terwilliger said, ""once a product is
taken out of the shipping container in the warehouse, you
really can't track it anymore."" Shipping container bar codes are already 14 digits. The
different bar-code standards mean that retailers need
different computer systems for shipping and receiving,
inventory and sales. By adopting a 14-digit standard,
retailers should be able to put all the information into a
single database. Mr. Poss said Ace had added the capacity to scan and store
14 digits when it made its conversion three years ago. ""Now
we can scan anything,"" he said, ""whether it's in the
warehouse or at the register, and it immediately goes in to
a centralized system. No more sending data between
divisions."" The cost and work of making the transition to 14 digits, he
said, was the same as it would have been for a change to 13
digits. Representatives from the standards groups said adopting a
14-digit structure - a step for which no date has been set
- could help streamline the sharing of data among all parts
of a retail operation. It would also make it possible, they
said, to identify products anywhere in the world at any
time during the trade process. ""And to think it all started with pack of gum,"" Mr. Poss
said. http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/12/technology/12CODE.html?ex=1030208144&ei=1&en=1b5705e7bd2048e6HOW TO ADVERTISE
